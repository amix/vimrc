    cscope for DOS using DJGPP
------------------------------------

*) You need a rather recent DJGPP version and tools
   installed. For running cscope on DOS, be sure you
   have:

   * GNU ed for cscope's automated editing of files. It's quite likely
     you didn't have this installed, unless you're a collector of Unix 
     tools. 

   * an editor or viewer to be used as a child program when you open
     a match, inside cscope. DJGPP-compiled versions, if possible.
     
     Choose either

     -- `less' if you're content with viewing the file
     -- some version of `vi' (VIM, Elvis, or NVI) use cscope in it's
        "classical" way
     -- GNU Emacs for the full glory :-)

     Set the environment variable CSCOPE_EDITOR or EDITOR to the name
     of the editor you want to use. You may want to create a [cscope]
     section in your djgpp.env file, if you know how to do it.

   For more details what cscope is, and how to use it, see the
   documentation in the root directory of the cscope sources, or the
   man page.

*) For compiling cscope from sources, you need a much more complete
   collection of GNU development and commandline tools, in addition
   to the above, and the obvious GCC and binutils:

   * bash
   * make
   * flex
   * bison
   * sed
   * patch
   * fileutils (cp, ln, ...)
   * textutils (cat)
   
   Optionally, if you plan to modify the sources.
  
   * autoconf
   * automake
   * Perl

   These are the ones I'm sure you need --- I may have overlooked some.

   The DJGPP source packages is already configured, so you can just
   run 'make' to get the package. Then 

	make install prefix=d:/djgpp"

   (or wherever else your DJGPP is) to install it.

   Or cd to the top source directory and execute the supplied
   djmake.bat:

	cd d:\djgpp\contrib\cscope
	packages\msdos\djmake.bat

   and watch it compile. This will be necessary if you made any
   substantial changes to the sources.

Have fun with it. In case of problem, mail to djgpp@delorie.com (or the
attached Usenet newsgroup) or file a bug report at cscope's page on
Sourceforge.net.
