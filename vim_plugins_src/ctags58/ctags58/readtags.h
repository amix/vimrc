*   This source code is released for the public domain.
*
*   This file defines the public interface for looking up tag entries in tag
*   files.
*
*   The functions defined in this interface are intended to provide tag file
*   support to a software tool. The tag lookups provided are sufficiently fast
*   enough to permit opening a sorted tag file, searching for a matching tag,
*   then closing the tag file each time a tag is looked up (search times are
*   on the order of hundreths of a second, even for huge tag files). This is
*   the recommended use of this library for most tool applications. Adhering
*   to this approach permits a user to regenerate a tag file at will without
*   the tool needing to detect and resynchronize with changes to the tag file.
*   Even for an unsorted 24MB tag file, tag searches take about one second.

/*
*  This function must be called before calling other functions in this
*  library. It is passed the path to the tag file to read and a (possibly
*  null) pointer to a structure which, if not null, will be populated with
*  information about the tag file. If successful, the function will return a
*  handle which must be supplied to other calls to read information from the
*  tag file, and info.status.opened will be set to true. If unsuccessful,
*  info.status.opened will be set to false and info.status.error_number will
*  be set to the errno value representing the system error preventing the tag
*  file from being successfully opened.

*  This function allows the client to override the normal automatic detection
*  of how a tag file is sorted. Permissible values for `type' are
*  TAG_UNSORTED, TAG_SORTED, TAG_FOLDSORTED. Tag files in the new extended
*  format contain a key indicating whether or not they are sorted. However,
*  tag files in the original format do not contain such a key even when
*  sorted, preventing this library from taking advantage of fast binary
*  lookups. If the client knows that such an unmarked tag file is indeed
*  sorted (or not), it can override the automatic detection. Note that
*  incorrect lookup results will result if a tag file is marked as sorted when
*  it actually is not. The function will return TagSuccess if called on an
*  open tag file or TagFailure if not.
