# The Ultimate vimrc

I've taken the [fantastic awesome vim](https://github.com/amix/vimrc) collection of plugins, and made some tweaks. They are all under the `my_configs.vimrc` file and basically add these essentials (for me): 

- Line numbers on the left
- Ruler at 80 chars
- Actual copying into the OSX clipboard (requires vim 7.4)

Easiest way to install this on a fresh workstation is the following: 
```
# vim setup
git clone https://github.com/maxArturo/vimrc.git ~/.vim_runtime
sh ~/.vim_runtime/install_awesome_vimrc.sh
```

I highly suggest you visit the parent repo and see the overview, or look at the actual `.vimrc` files â€“ which are very well documented. Enjoy!
