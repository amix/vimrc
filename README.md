# The Ultimate vimrc

I've taken the [fantastic awesome vim](https://github.com/amix/vimrc) collection of plugins, and made some tweaks. They are all under the `my_configs.vimrc` file and basically add these essentials (for me): 

- Line numbers on the left
- Ruler at 80 chars
- Actual copying into the OSX clipboard (requires vim 7.4)

I highly suggest you visit the parent repo and see the overview, or look at the actual `.vimrc` files â€“ which are very well documented. Enjoy!
