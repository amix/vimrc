WebCScope Installation

Quick Install

0. Create a directory called cscope under your /cgi-bin (virtual) directory.
	Copy all the files in the distribution to this directory.

1. Edit the 'cscope' file and change the following items:
	- Location to the perl interpreter
	- Location of the cscope database and other modifiable parameters
	- Feedback name and email
	- Location of the syntax highlighter, if you wish to use it

2. Syntax highlighter
	- The syntax highlighter must be built if you decide to use it.  If you
		do not want syntax highlighting, you can ignore this step and set the
		highlighter to /bin/cat.
	- Compile 'hilite.c' using 'gcc -o hilite hilite.c'

3. Icons
	- Copy the images from the icons directory into the /icons (virtual)
		directory on the web server.  You can also replace these images with
		whatever you choose.

4. Organizing your CScope databases
	- WebCScope supports multiple databases in $cscopedir
	- Create a directory for each project or sub-source in $cscopedir and, 
		generate your cscope database using the following commands.
		- find /some/source/dir -name '*.[chyls]' -print > cscope.files
		- cscope -b -q
	- Repeat the above step for each database you wish to create
