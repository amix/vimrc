***** BUILDING:

This program's build procedure is fairly standard.  Try:

	./configure
	make
	make install

Options to the configure script are up to you.  For details, run:

	./configure --help

Please report build problems at:

	http://sourceforge.net/bugs/?func=addbug&group_id=4664

(yes, even non-Linux problems).


***** TIPS AND PROBLEMS:

- Try to use flex as the lexical analyzer.  The lex scanner is now
separated from the flex version to allow the flex scanner to be
optimized.  It's also a lot harder to diagnose and debug problems
without having full access to the particular platform and its version of
lex being used.  flex is available everywhere --- AT&T lex is not.

- On Solaris, the native lex fails to catch our redefinition of YYLMAX
early enough, which leads to possible buffer overflows.

- On Linux systems (and possibly others) configure may fail if lex is
  a synomyn for flex.  To fix, do the following:

	make distclean
	./configure --with-flex
	make

- On HP-UX several problems exist when using configure. Try the following
  to solve this:

	CFLAGS='-Ae -DYYCHAR_ARRAY' CURSES_LIBS=-lHcurses ./configure

- On Tru64, formerly known as Digital Unix, formerly known as DEC OSF/1,
  the system-supplied libcurses causes cscope to terminate itself
  immediately as it comes back to foreground after being suspended by
  the user (Ctrl-Z). Using GNU Ncurses instead of OSF1 curses works
  around the problem. According to the lynx and ncurses people, this
  is a design problem of curses vs. signal handling, at the heart of it.

- Solaris 2.8 on Intel hardware may not work using the vendor's curses
  implementation.  Using the free NCurses should help.

- Some ancient Unix filesytems supported only 14 characters in 
  filenames.  cscope no longer cares for that by default.  If you want
  to run it on such a system, #define the macro SHORT_NAMES_ONLY manually
  (there's a definition in global.h you can uncomment).
