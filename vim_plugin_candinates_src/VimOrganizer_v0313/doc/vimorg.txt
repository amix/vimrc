2. *VimOrganizer_Overview*                                 *vimorg-overview*

VimOrganizer is a Vim filetype plugin that attempts to clone Emacs' Org-mode.  
It is currently (September 2011) in an alpha-stage, both in terms of (1) the 
breadth and depth of Org-mode features it clones and (2) its level of polish 
and presence of bugs.  It's nevertheless very usable in its current state.

Org-mode, and thus VimOrganizer, is a text-editor add-on/application that can 
be used for (1) keeping notes, (2) maintaining TODO lists, (3) planning 
projects, and/or (4) authoring and publishing documents, including support for 
literate programming.  Like Org-mode, VimOrganizer does this by implementing a 
flexible plain-text system using a lightly structured document format.  
Org-mode has been in constant development for seven or eight years, and 
continues to be developed.  Work on VimOrganizer is likewise ongoing, but 
VimOrganizer is at present a much smaller and less ambitious project than 
Org-mode.

VimOrganizer also allows Vim users to make use of Org-babel, a subproject of 
Org-mode that allows execution of source-code blocks in org-format 
documents.  Uses for Org-babel range from writing technical research papers to 
simply using a VimOrganizer document as a "language-scratchpad".  Over 
twenty languages are supported, including C, R, Lisp, Python, Perl, Ruby, 
and others.  VimOrganizer calls out to a running Emacs server for Org-babel 
processing; functionality and speed are basically the same as 
when editing with Org-mode in Emacs.

VimOrganizer doesn't have much documentation yet.  The best way to learn how
to use VimOrganizer is to learn the basics of Emacs' Org-mode.  VimOrganizer
uses the same basic concepts but implements them within the context of Vim
and with a reduced feature set.  (Parts of this help file were
copied from Org-mode's documentation.)  Org-mode's main documentation and 
support newsgroup are found here:
Org-mode Main Manual:  http://orgmode.org/manual/index.html
Org-mode Compact Guide: http://orgmode.org/guide/index.html
Org-mode support newsgroup:  http://news.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.orgmode 
Org-babel information: http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/ 

File formats and basic workflows for VimOrganizer and Org-mode are very
similar, and VimOrganizer actually calls out to an Emacs' Org-mode server to 
implement important features, e.g., exporting to html and pdf formats.  
Thus, to make full use of VimOrganizer you will often want to have an Emacs' 
server running alongside.  In most cases this requires little knowledge of 
Emacs other than how to start it up and add a few lines to the '.emacs' file, 
Emacs' counterpart to Vim's '.vimrc'.  (You can even edit the .emacs file in 
Vim.)

===============================================================================
*VimOrganizer_Document_Structure*                *vimorg-document-structure*

VimOrganizer documents (an "Org document") are organized around a basic
outline structure.  Headlines define the structure of an outline tree. The
headlines in an Org document start with one or more stars, which must start on
the leftmost column.  For example:

------ sample Org-format outline below --------------------------------
* Top level headline
** Second level
*** 3rd level
    some text
*** 3rd level
    more text

* Another top level headline
  more text
------ sample Org-format outline above --------------------------------

An overview of this structure is achieved by folding (hiding) large parts of
the document to show only the general document structure and the parts
currently being worked on. VimOrganizer simplifies the use of outlines by
compressing the entire show/hide functionality of a heading and its subtree
into a simple "cycle" operation, which is bound to the <TAB> key.  A user can
cycle through several views, from fully folded to unfolded, by repeated
presses of <TAB>.  While <TAB> operates on the structure of a single heading,
<shift-TAB> performs an analogous cycle operation on the document as a whole.

Because all of the folds in VimOrganizer are ordinary Vim folds, users can
also manipulate folds with the usual array of Vim fold commands: zc, zv, zo,
etc.

===============================================================================
*VimOrganizer_File_Compatibility* with Org-mode:      *vimorg-org-compatiblity*

VimOrganizer's file format is nearly identical to Org-mode.  There are
currently a couple of differences:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. *Metadata-blocks*                             *vimorg-metadata-format*

In VimOrganizer lines in a heading's metadata must (1) immediately follow
the heading line, and (2) all begin with a colon followed by a 
non-whitespace character.  

Blocks of metadata typically follow a heading in Org-mode documents, but
Org-mode doesn't require this.  That is, the metadata can be anywhere in the
text block of a heading.  Also, in Org-mode some, but not all (e.g., dates),
metadata lines are preceded by a colon (:) character.  E.g.,

------ sample Org-format outline below ----------
* Top level headline
  DEADLINE:<2011-11-13 Thu>
  :PROPERTIES:
  :SOMEPROP:SomePropValue
  :END:
  One or more lines of text for heading here. . . . 
  SCHEDULED:<2011-11-12 Wed>
  One or more lines of text for heading here. . . .
** subheading
** another subheading
------ sample Org-format outline above ---------

The sample above should be formatted like this in
VimOrganizer, with the SCHEDULED date moved above
PROPERTIES and colons preceding the date lines:

------ sample VimOrganizer-format outline below -----
* Top level headline
  :DEADLINE:<2011-11-13 Thu>
  :SCHEDULED:<2011-11-12 Wed>
  :PROPERTIES:
  :SOMEPROP:SomePropValue
  :END:
  One or more lines of text for heading here. . . .
** subheading
** another subheading
------ sample VimOrganizer-format outline above ----

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.  Tag format in VimOrganizer                  *vimorg-tag-format*

The second major difference between VimOrganizer and Org-mode is in the
format of tag data.  In Org-mode tags are included on heading lines as
following the end of the heading.  In VimOrganizer tags are included as part 
of the metadata block and must be on the first line following a heading. 

For example, tags in Org-mode look like this:

------ sample Org-format tags below ----------
* Top level headline       :tagone:tagtwo:tagthree:
  :PROPERTIES:
  :SOMEPROP:SomePropValue
  :END:
  One or more lines of text for heading here. . . . 
------ sample Org-format tags above ---------

The same tags in VimOrganizer would look like this:

------ sample VimOrganizer-format tags below ----------
* Top level headline      
  :tagone:tagtwo:tagthree:
  :PROPERTIES:
  :SOMEPROP: SomePropValue
  :END:
  One or more lines of text for heading here. . . . 
------ sample VimOrganizer-format tags above ---------

In practice the difference is less visible, since for folded headings the
default settings in VimOrganizer can show the tags on the same line as the 
heading text.  (See |vimorg-column-view|)  

==============================================================================

VimOrganizer / Emacs Interaction              *vimorg-emacs-interaction*
                                              *vimorg-emacs-setup*

3.  Calling an Emacs client from VimOrganizer         *vimorg-invoking-emacs*

For features where Vim/VimOrganizer call out to an Emacs client, setup
must be configured to properly invoke the Emacs client.  This differs depending
on whether the user is running Windows or a Linux/OS X OS.

First, of course, Emacs must be installed and Org-mode must be set up
properly.  Recent Emacs installs include Org-mode and should work without any
more configuration than a basic install.  A '.org' file should be opened in
Emacs to confirm this.  Emacs can be obtained from a link at
http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs.

a.  On WINDOWS.  The variable, g:org_command_for_emacsclient, must be 
assigned in your vimrc file with a command that will open an emacs client 
on your system.  On Windows the associated exe file is emacsclientw.exe 
in Emacs' bin directory.  By default Emacs is installed with 
a path that includes spaces in a directory name (viz., '/program files/).  
The complex command that VimOrganizer constructs to call 
Emacs won't work if the command invoking Emacs itself
includes a space.  There are two ways to work around this: 1. Create a
"symbolic link" to the Emacs client executable that doesn't have a space and 
include that link as value of g:org_command_for_emacs, e.g.,

     let g:org_command_for_emacsclient = c:\users\george\emacsclientw

On Windows7 or Vista, the link can be created with Windows' MKLINK command line utility:

     mklink c:\users\george\emacsclientw c:\program files(x86)\Emacs\emacs\bin\emacsclientw.exe

Alternatively, rather than create a symbolic link having a path with no
spaces, a user can add the directory to the environment's path variable, so
that the emacsclient can be invoked simply by issuing the command
'emacsclientw', without including any element of its path.  In that case you
would include this assignment in your vimrc:

     let g:org_command_for_emacsclient = emacsclientw.exe


b.  ON LINUX/OS X.  On Linux the executable to start an Emacs client is 
named emacsclient.  In general all you need to do is put this line 
in your vimrc:

     let g:org_command_for_emacsclient = emacsclient

NOTE: Unlike the Emacs client on Windows, emacsclient on Linux will NOT start 
up an Emacs server if one is not running, the emacsclient command will simply 
fail.
Thus, at least for the time being, the user must manually start Emacs before
using Emacs features from VimOrganizer, and in the running Emacs instance must
issue the server-start command, either by putting it in the .emacs file or by
issuing the command manually within Emacs (alt-x server-start).

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

4.  *Conversion_between_Org-mode_and_VimOrganizer*   *vimorg-orgmode-conversion*

In practice nothing may go drastically wrong if you don't have perfect
formatting, either in VimOrganizer or Org-mode, but VimOrganizer by default is
set to convert Org-mode documents to its own format upon opening.  Also, it is
recommended to put a "hook" function in your .emacs file to convert
VimOrganizer-format documents to Org-mode format upon opening.  Once set up in
this way you shouldn't need to worry about formatting differences.  The 
code to add to your .emacs file is below:

--------- elisp code for .emacs ---------------------
(defun vimorg-tag-adjust ()
  (interactive)
   (while (re-search-forward "^*.*?\n[ \t]+:[^ \t]+:" nil t)
         (if (not (string-match "\\(PROPERTIES\\|LOGBOOK\\)" (thing-at-point 'line)))
              (join-line))))

(defun vimorg-set-unmodified ()
    (interactive)
    (set-buffer-modified-p nil))

(add-hook 'org-mode-hook
(lambda () (interactive)(replace-regexp "\\(\\s-*\\):\\(DEADLINE\\|CLOSED\\|SCHEDULED\\|CLOCK\\|<[0-9]\\{4\\}-[0-9]\\{2\\}-[0-9]\\{2\\} \\)" "\\1\\2")
                (beginning-of-buffer)(vimorg-tag-adjust)
        (beginning-of-buffer) ))
-----------------------------------------------------

==============================================================================
Metadata                                      *vimorg-metadata*
                                        

Org-mode has three different kinds of metadata: tags, todos, and properties.
Here is how to set up and edit them.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Todos                                         *vimorg-todo-metadata*

*Todos* are single_words that can appear in a heading after the last asterisk
and immediately before the first word of the heading.  By default the todos
are: (1) TODO and (2) DONE, to identify headings that are tasks that need to
be done, and headlines that are done tasks.

A user can cycle between todo states by pressing <s-enter> in Normal mode
with the cursor on a headline.  Here is how the todos would cycle with the
default setup of TODO and DONE todos:

        *   Work on final report
        *   TODO Work on final report (after user presses <s-enter>)
        *   DONE Work on final report (after second press of <s-enter>)
        *   Work on final report      (after third press of <s-enter>)

The global default for todos setup is in g:org_todo_setup.  If you want to
change the todo states you can reassign g:org_todo_setup in your vimrc.  For
example, the line below would add a 'STARTED' state to indicate todos that
had been started but were not yet finished:

       let g:org_todo_setup='TODO STARTED | DONE'

Per-file defaults can be set by including a config line in a particular .org
file.  For example, the config line below would add a CANCELLED keyword to
the todo cycle in a specific document:

       #+TODO: TODO STARTED | DONE CANCELLED

Please see the Org-mode documentation for more info on todos.  It should be 
helpful, even though not all Org-mode todo features are implemented yet in 
VimOrganizer:  http://orgmode.org/manual/TODO-Items.html.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tags                                                 *vimorg-tag-metadata*

Tags offer a way of attaching multiple labels or contexts to a single heading.
Tags are added to a heading by putting them on the line immediately after
the heading, with each tag preceded and followed by a single colon.  E.g.,
here is a heading with two tags:

   * Example heading
     :work:urgent:

You can add whatever tags you wish by editing the tag line directly, however 
it's usually preferable to use VimOrganizer's system for setting up and
editing tags.  Global tags setup is held in the variable, g:org_tag_setup,
which by default holds the setup string '{home(h) work(w)}'.  You can override
the global setup by including a config line in a particular file.  E.g.,:

   #+TAGS: { work(w) home(h) tennisclub(t) } laptop(l) pc(p)

The braces in the example above indicate that the tags inside are mutually
exclusive, so choosing one will automatically delete any other.  The letters
in parentheses provide single-key selection when using VimOrganizer's
tag editing menu. (Single-key letters will be assigned automatically if
not explicitly assigned in the tag setup string.

The tag editing menu can be opened by choosing 'Edit Tags' from the Org
menu, or by pressing ',et' in Normal mode.

Although not all Org-mode tag functionality is present in VimOrganizer, it
may be helpful to review the Org-mode tag docs at:
http://orgmode.org/manual/Tags.html#Tags

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Properties                                     *vimorg-property-metadata*

Properties offer a way to attach key/value pairs to headings in a document.
These pairs must be included, one per line, in between a :PROPERTIES: and
an :END: marker beneath a heading.  For example:

      * Example heading
        :PROPERTIES:
        :Title:     Goldberg Variations
        :Composer:  J.S. Bach
        :Artist:    Glen Gould
        :Publisher: Deutsche Grammophon
        :NDisks:    1
        :END:

For more information on how properties work, please refer to the Org-mode
documentation:  
http://orgmode.org/manual/Properties-and-Columns.html#Properties-and-Columns

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dates                                             *vimorg-date-metadata*

Dates are another form of metadata that can be associated with a heading.
The following commands may be issued anywhere within a headline and will 
enter or edit the corresponding date for the headline.  One date of 
each type may be defined per headline (i.e, 'DEADLINE', 'SCHEDULED', 
'CLOSED', and 'timestamp').  You can enter more dates anywhere you want, but 
this editing mechanism is currently restricted to dealing with only these
"primary" dates.

Command  Result
,dd     enter DEADLINE date for headline
,ds     enter SCHEDULED date for headline
,dc     enter CLOSED date for headline
,dt     enter timestamp date (i.e., no indicator) for headline
,dg     set date at cursor

The command-line prompt and calendar that appear when you execute a ',d_'
command operate nearly the same as the date-time prompt in Emacs'
Org-mode.  Some options are not yet implemented (e.g., the 'w'eek
options), but most should work just the same.  For documentation 
on Org-mode's date-time prompt see:
http://orgmode.org/manual/The-date_002ftime-prompt.html#The-date_002ftime-prompt

Except when using the 'set date at cursor' option, the date will be located
beneath the heading, immediately after any tag line, and immediately before
any PROPERTIES block.  Dates added in other locations will be searched 
when using VimOrganizer's searches, but they aren't strictly speaking part
of the 'metadata block' that immediately follows a heading.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Categories                                             *vimorg-categories*

Categories are yet another form of metadata in Org files.  Categories
are useful because a headings 'Category' is displayed as the first column
of dsta in a heading line in Agenda results.  (Remember that there
is limited space for display, try to keep category names less than 
10 characters.)  By default a heading's Category will be its file name. 
However you can change this in several ways.

First, you can establish a new category for an entire document by 
placing a category config line at the top of the document.  All
headings in the document will inherit it as their default.  Like 
all config lines, it must begin in the leftmost column of the buffer,
e.g.,:

#+CATEGORY: MyCategory

All headings in the document would no display that as the first column
when they are part of an agenda result.

Second, you can override a document's default category by giving a 
heading a category property, like this:
------------------------
* Heading One
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CATEGORY: NewCategory
  :END:
** Subheading One
** Subheading TWo
* Heading Two
------------------------
In the snippet above, Heading One's category would be 'NewCategory'. 
Categories are inherited by subheadings, so Subheading One and Sub-
heading Two would also be 'NewCategory'.  Heading Two, on the other
hand, would inherit the category from a config line, if any, or it's
category would be the file name (excluding the . and extension).

You can read more about how categories work here:
http://orgmode.org/manual/Categories.html#Categories
NOTE:  Although Org-mode still supports multiple category config
lines in a document, each affecting text occurring after it (and 
before another category config line), VimOrganizer does not 
suppor this.  You can put one CATEGORY config line in a document and
it will be inherited by any heading that does not have a CATEGORY
property (or inherit a CATEGORY property from an ancestor heading).

=============================================================================
VimOrganizer commands                                        *vimorg-commands*

VimOrganizer commands are listed below, along with the normal-mode
keystrokes to invoke them.  (<localleader> in VimOrganizer documents
is by default the comma (",") character, which accounts for the commas
in the commands below):

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Modifying view of the outline structure        *vimorg-view-commands*

View Document Structure           Show entire document with headings
,,N                               expanded to outline level N.
where N is for level 1-9

View Subtree Structure            Show current subtree with headings 
,N                                expanded to outline level N.
where N is for level 1-9
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Adding new headings                          *vimorg-new-headings*

New headings can of course be added by normal Vim text editing, create
a new line and put one or more asterisks starting flush with the left
column.  Normal mode commands below are shortcuts to do the same thing.


new heading same level           Insert a new heading of current level
<CR> in normal mode              after current heading's subtree.
<S-CR> in insert mode 

new subhead                       Insert a new heading that is a 
<C-CR>                            subhead of current heading

new parent head                   Insert a new heading that is at 
<S-C-CR>                          the level of current subhead's parent

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Heading Navigation                         *vimorg-navigation*

VimOrganizer has commands that let you navigate a document by outline
node.  Some outline navigation commands are not mapped to keys but are
available on the menu.

Up to parent                      Move cursor to parent heading.
<a-left-arrow>

Previous sibling                  Move cursor to previous heading
<a-up-arrow>                      of same level in current subtree.

Next sibling                      Move cursor to next heading of
<a-down-arrow>                    same level in current subtree

First child                       Move cursor to first child heading
<a-right-arrow>                   of current heading.

Last child                        Move cursor to last child heading
                              of current heading.

Next heading                      . . . to next heading of any kind

Previous heading                  . . . to previous heading of any kind

Next heading same level           . . . to next heading of same level
                              regardless of whether it is in 
                              current subtree

Previous heading same level       . . . to next heading of same level
                              regardless of whether it is in 
                              current subtree
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Editing Document Structure                *vimorg-structure-editing*

These commands let you move entire sections of a document based on its
outline structure.

Move subtree up            Move current subtree to position 
<c-a-uparrow>              before previous subtree.

Move subtree down          Move current subtree to position
<c-a-downarrow>            after next subtree.

Promote subtree            Move entire subtree to be parent
<c-a-leftarrow>            heading's level and position after
                       parent subtree.

Demote subtree             Move entire subtree to be child
<c-a-rightarrow>           of previous heading of same level.
--------------------------------------------------------------
Character formatting                       *vimorg-character-formatting*

These commands automatically add the markup Org-mode uses to print
documents with specially formatted text.  Text can be selected
prior to issuing command to wrap text in markup or just issue
the command then add text between the markup delimiters.

NOTE: these delimiters do NOT format phrases that span 
over a line break, they are for same line only.  If you
want to format over two or more lines you need to apply 
to each word in the lines (for safety when reformatting)
or to the begin and end of each line (which will pose
problems upon reformatting).

Bold text                uses * delimiters
,cb

Italic text              uses / delimiters
,ci

Underline text           uses _ delimiters
,cu

Code text                uses = delimiters to specify 
,cc                      monospaced unformatted text

----------------------------------------------------
Footnotes                                    *vimorg-footnotes*

VimOrganizer has no special support for footnotes yet.  However footnotes can
still be easily included, and upon export will be properly positioned
formatted (and linked, depending on the output format).  The special support
that will be added consists mostly of automatically assembling footnote text
in a separate portion of the document. 

You can add footnotes in any of the following ways:

  [fn::text of footnote here]      This inline method will make the 
                                   text into a footnote and add a
                                   proper footnote reference at the 
                                   position of the reference.

  [fn:name:text of footnote here]  This inline method allows the same 
                                   note to be referenced by another
                                   note reference of this form:
                                   [fn:name]

  [fn:name]                        This creates a reference point in
                                   the document that will be numbered
                                   and linked to the footnote text with
                                   the same name.  The text of the foot-,
                                   note is entered in a separate
                                   paragraph of its own, located
                                   anywhere in the document but always
                                   beginning in column 0, like this:

[fn:name] This paragraph (text to next blank line) is the note
for the footnote reference: name.  Upon export numbers will be 
substituted for all of the footnote names in the document.

See the Org-mode documentation for more complete information
on footnotes.  Remember, you can use them in VimOrganizer, the
main thing missing is automatic gathering of all the note
text at a common point in the document:
http://orgmode.org/manual/Footnotes.html#Footnotes

----------------------------------------------------
Refiling                         *vimorg-refile-heading*
                                 *vimorg-jump-to-headng*

Refiling involves moving a subtree structure
to a new location, either in the current document or
another document.  One set of refile comman(The user interface for 
this is currently barebones and not optimal, like many other 
things it will be revised. . . .)

  Refile to point
  ,rh                        Move current subtree to be subchild
                         of heading at a different location.
                         Invoking this command first presents
                         you with a 'Target file:' prompt, at
                         which you can use <Tab> to choose the
                         file target.  Then press <Enter> to
                         get a list of top-level headings in
                         the selected file.  If you want to
                         select a lower-level heading then add
                         a '/' and press <Tab> to get list of
                         direct subheadings of the heading, or
                         '*' and <Tab> to get list of all levels
                         of subheads of selected heading.  Finally,
                         <Enter> to choose the heading to refile to,
                         or <Esc> to cancel the refile.
  
  Refile, jump to point
  ,rj                        Uses same prompt as 'Refile to point' command,
                         but instead of moving subtree there simply
                         moves cursor to that point (which may involve
                         moving to a different buffer if chosen point
                         is not in current buffer).
  
  Refile, set persistent
  refile point
  ,rs                        Same prompt as for 'Refile to point' command,
                         but instead of refiling it saves the
                         chosen file and heading to be used as 
                         target of subsequent 'Refile to Persistent
                         Point' command.
  
  Refile to persistent
  refile point
  ,rp                        Move current subtree to location defined
                         by the persistent refile point.
  
  
  Refile, jump to persistent point
  ,rx                        Move cursor to file/heading that is persistent
                         refile point.

Keybindings                              *vimorg-keybindings*

Keybindings are still a moving target.  I'm happy to hear from people
who think they've found better command bindings.  You can look up bindings
(1) in this help file, (2) in the menu in g(raphical)vim, which lists
binding next to command you choose, and/or in the vimorg-main-mappings.vim 
and vimorg-agenda-mappings.vim scripts in the ftplugin directory.  A few
mappings, mostly agenda stuff, are also made in the main org.vim ftplugin
file.  The keybindings are messy and will be cleaned up at some point.

                                     *vimorg-keybindings-terminal*
TERMINAL KEYBINDINGS.  It's important to understand that many of the 
default bindings are NOT available in many or all versions of vim running
on terminals.  This is the fault of the terminal for not handling the 
particular key combination.  Here's a link to an Org-mode webpage listing
common key combinations that are not available in terminals, with suggested
Emacs alternatives.  Vim keybindings are of course different (no crazy
chord combinations), but the suggestions there might give you ideas for
mappings you want to do for yourself:
http://orgmode.org/manual/TTY-keys.html#TTY-keys

Below are the alternate mappings already in VimOrganizer for the most
commonly-used key combinations that aren't available in terminals. They
are found at the bottom of the file, vimorg-main-mappings.vim in the
ftplugin folder:

,<tab>             GlobalCycle                  (same as <shift-TAB> in gvim)
<localleader>zu    Node navigate up             (same as <alt-up>...        ) 
<localleader>zd    Node Navigate down           (same as <alt-down>...      )
<localleader>zl    Node navigate left           (same as <alt-left>...      )
<localleader>zr    Node navigate right          (same as <alt-right>...     )
<localleader>zL    Promote heading tree         (same as <ctrl-alt-left>... )
<localleader>zR    Demote headng tree           (same as <ctrl-alt-right>...)
<localleader>k     Move heading tree up         (same as <ctrl-alt-up>...   )
<localleader>j     Move headng tree down        (same as <ctrl-alt-down>... )
<localleader>np    Add new heading node below at parent's level (<c-s-enter>)
<localleader>ns    Add new heading node below at subhead level (<c-enter>)


------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hyperlinks                               *vimorg-hyperlinks* *vimorg-links*

VimOrganizer uses the same hyperlink markup style as Org-mode, but doesn't
support as many types of links.  You can read about the Org-mode link
format here:  http://orgmode.org/manual/Hyperlinks.html#Hyperlinks .

While you can add and edit links with VimOrganizer without it, to follow
external links you must have the UTL Vim plugin installed.  You can find it
here:
http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=293 .
UTL itself does not use Org-mode compatible links, but it is used by
VimOrganizer behind the scenes to follow links.

In general, an Org-mode formatted link looks like this:

    [[link_specification][descriptive_link_name]

You can also use a link with no descriptive name:

    [[link_specification]]

Here is an example that links to the Yahoo home page:

    [[http://www.yahoo.com][Yahoo home page]]

If using a Vim version that has the 'conceal' feature, VimOrganizer allows
you to set your display so that the brackets and the link specification
are hidden, and you see only the highlighted *descriptive_link_name* .
(If the link has a link-specification only, no descriptive name, then 
just the brackets will be hidden in conceal mode.)


Add/edit link                 Allows you to edit a link in the command line.
,le                           You are first prompted for the link
                              specification, then press <enter> and you 
                              will be prompted for a link name.

Follow link                   Will "follow" a link.  With web url's this
,lf                           will open a browser, with files it will
(or just press <enter>        open the file in an appropriate app if a
cursor on the link)           handler app has been defined.  (UTL setup
                              has default set of handlers and can be 
                              changed.)  Internal links will move to 
                              associated spot within a vimorg document.

                              NOTE:  The Org-mode format requires that
                              the 'http://' prefix be included when specifying
                              web urls.  Link will fail if you don't 
                              include 'http://'.

Next link                     Moves to next link in the document.
,ln

Previous link                 Moves to previous link in the document.
,lp

Perma-compress links          There are three types of link "compression".
,lc                           All work only in Vim version 7.3 or later
Auto-compress links           that is compiled with the conceal feature.
,la                           Perma-compress will keep the link com-
Do not compress links         pressed using Vim's conceal feature unless
,lx                           you are Insert mode.  (You can always edit
                              a link directly in Insert mode as well as
                              using the 'Add/edit link' function.)
                              Auto-compress keeps link ends concealed 
                              in Normal mode except it automatically expands
                              all links on the same line as the cursor.
                              'Do not compress' option sets things to always 
                              show the entire link text (and is the only
                              option that works in Vim versions prior to 7.3).

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Narrowing Regions                                    *vimorg-narrowing*

VimOrganizer uses Christian Brabandt's NrwRgn plugin to edit subsections
of an outline in separate window.  For outline sections this function is
sometimes called "hoisting".  There are two different kinds of narrowing: (1)
narrowing of a subtree, and (2) narrowing of a code block.

Narrow heading tree         When on a heading will "narrow" it and its
,nh                         entire subtree to a separate window.

Narrow code block           When cursor is inside a code block (i.e., a
,nc                         block beginning with *#+begin_src* ) this
                            will open the contents of a code block for
                            editing in a separate window.  In most cases
                            the language of the code block will be recognized
                            and the new window will treat it as the 
                            appropriate filetype, with correct syntax 
                            highlighting and indenting.

When editing a narrowed region in a separate window, the main buffer will
be uneditable and the region that was narrowed will be highlighted within it.
The narrowed region in the separate window is in a buffer that is different
fron the buffer from the main document, so changes made in it are not
immediately reflected in the original buffer.  To save changes use the *write*
command, *wq* to write and quit, or just *q* to abandon unsaved changes and
return to original buffer.  See help for |NarrowRegion| for more information.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tables in VimOrganizer                             *vimorg-tables-editing*

Tables in VimOrganizer work very much like they work in Org-mode.  
VimOrganizer uses some of the table code from the excellent VimWiki project.
Other major parts of the table functionality come from calling directly
to Org-mode in Emacs to evaluate or manipulate a table.

Regardless of the editing functionality available in VimOrganizer,
the behavior of tables in export will be identical to what it is
in Org-mode, since exports are in fact done by Org-mode.

Table operations are accessed through the Table Dashboard.  You can open
the dashboard with the command :OrgTableDashboard or the key sequence
,b.  The table dashboard is context-sensitive.  Operations accessible 
on the table dashboard are as follows:

1. When cursor is on a blank line    You are prompted to create
                                     a new table, which you can do
                                     by specifying rows and columns.

2. When cursor is on non-table text  You will be prompted to create a
                                     table from the block of text you
                                     are on.  The block is defined as
                                     the area between the previous
                                     blank line and the next blank
                                     line.  This operation calls out
                                     to Org-mode and processes the 
                                     text block with the elisp
                                     function 'org-convert-table-region'.
                                     The text will be split into a
                                     table based on the following rules:

                                     a. If every line contains at least 
                                        one TAB character, the function
                                        assumes that the material is tab 
                                        separated.
                                     b. If every line contains a comma, 
                                        comma-separated values (CSV) are 
                                        assumed. 
                                     c. If neither of above apply, lines 
                                        are split at whitespace into fields.

3. When cursor is on a table.  In this case a full dashboard is shown.
                               All user options call out to Org-mode
                               in Emacs to process the table.  This is
                               done even for relatively simple options,
                               since the #+TBLFM line may change.  See
                               Org-mode documenation regading these
                               options and how tables and spreadsheet
                               functionality works:
                               http://orgmode.org/manual/Tables.html#Tables

     Dashboard operations:     All of these operations depend on the 
                               position of the cusor within the table.

     'COLUMN' operatons:  l -- move column left
                          r -- move column right
                          e -- delete column
                          o -- insert column

     'ROW' operations     d -- move row down
                          u -- move row up
                          x -- delete row
                          i -- insert row

     Insert horiontal line  -- h will insert a line below cursor

     'RowSort' operations:  all of the row sort operations operate
                            on the current 'row-region' of the table.
                            A row region is the range of rows including
                            the cursor row up to (1) beginning-of-table
                            or a horizontal line above, and down to (2) the
                            end-of-table or a horizontal line below.

                            Available sorts are
                              a  -- alphabetical, a to z
                              A  -- reverse alphabetical, z-a
                              n  -- numeric, low to high
                              N  -- numeric, high to low

Table Evaluation                           *vimorg-table-evaluation*

Spreadsheet functionality is supported by calling out to Org-mode
in Emacs.  You cause this by putting the cursor in a table and
choosing '(T)able, E(v)aluate Table' from the menu in gvim, or 
by pressing |,v|.  Evaluation will do two things:

    (1)  If cursor is in a table cell with a valid row/col
         formula, it will be moved into the #+TBLFM string.
    (2)  Formulas defined in the TBLFM string will be 
         evaluated and results will be placed in appropriate
         cells in the table.

Since the table is evaluated in Emacs, all of the spreadsheet 
formulas are evaluated as specified in the Org-mode manual:
http://orgmode.org/manual/The-spreadsheet.html#The-spreadsheet

NOTE:  Be sure to note that the default evaluation does _NOT_
       follow the rule of equal precedence of multiplication
       and decision.  Instead, division has lower precedence
       than multiplication:

             2/3*4 == 2 / (3 * 4)

       See:  http://orgmode.org/manual/Formula-syntax-for-Calc.html#Formula-syntax-for-Calc

Colors and highlighting in VimOrganizer        *vimorg-colors*
                                               *vimorg-colorschemes*
                                               *vimorg-highlighting*

VimOrganizer works well with many different Vim colorschemes.  It will
automatically adjust highlighting for major items when a new 
colorscheme is loaded.  Colors for heading lines are mapped to
the colors a colorscheme sets for the following syntax items:

                Outline Level 1   -   Statement
                Outline Level 2   -   Identifier
                Outline Level 3   -   Constant
                Outline Level 4   -   Comment
                Outline Level 5   -   Special

Many elements in VimOrganizer documents have highlighting that is not
affected by generic colorschemes.  These include items like TODO
keywords, tags, properties, configuration lines, etc.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
                                          *vimorg-customizing-colors*
The main way to change highlighting is to add a special function to your
vimrc.  This function is called when a VimOrganizer file is loaded
and whenever a colorscheme is changed.  It provides a spot to write
your own highlight statements (see  |highlight| ) to override the
default settings.

function! OrgCustomColors()
    " various Org syntax item highlighting statements are below
    " these are the current defaults.  Uncomment and edit a line if you
    " want different highlighting fof the element

    " below are defaults for any TODOS you define.  TODOS that
    " come before the | in a definition will use  'NOTDONETODO'
    " and those that come after are DONETODO
    "hi! DONETODO guifg=green ctermfg=green
    "hi! NOTDONETODO guifg=red ctermfg=lightred

    " heading level highlighting is done in pairs, one for the
    " heading when unfoled and one for folded.  Default is to make
    " them the same except for the folded version being bold:
    " assign OL1 pair for level 1, OL2 pair for level 2, etc.
    "hi! OL1 guifg=somecolor guibg=somecolor 
    "hi! OL1Folded guifg=somecolor guibg=somecolor gui=bold


    " tags are lines below headings that have :colon:separated:tags:
    "hi! Org_Tag guifg=lightgreen ctermfg=blue

    "  lines that begin with '#+' in column 0 are config lines
    "hi! Org_Config_Line guifg=darkgray ctermfg=magenta

    "drawers are :PROPERTIES: and :LOGBOOK: lines and their associated

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Custom TODO highlighting                    *vimorg-custom-todo-highlights*

VimOrganizer will automatically highlight DONETODOs and NOTDONETODOs with
a default color, or color you assign in OrgCustomColors().  If you
want to assign custom highlighting for one or more TODOs then
you need to create a dictionary with appropriate values.
Below is an illustration:


   Problem:  You want to create custom highlights for the NEXT 
             and WAITING todos in the todo setup of:
             'TODO NEXT WAITING | DONE CANCELED'

   Solution:  put statement like the one below in OrgCustomColors()
              function in your vimrc, (or somewhere in vimrc below
              the OrgCustomColors() func, if any):

       let g:org_todo_custom_highlights = 
               \     { 'NEXT': { 'guifg':'#888888', 'guibg':'#222222',
               \              'ctermfg':'gray', 'ctermbg':'darkgray'}
               \      'WAITING': { 'guifg':'red', 
               \                 'ctermfg':'red' } }
                        
   NOTE:  (1) Vim has unusual punctuation in its dictionary assignments.
          Note that each of the items in the statement above is a string,
          and that keys are separated from their values by a colon.
          (2) You can override one or more of the highlight items:
              guifg, guibg, ctermfg, ctermbg  

========================================================================
Searches and the Agenda                    *vimorg-agenda* *vimorg-searches*

The agenda is a buffer where VimOrganizer gathers heading lines from 
one or more buffers in response to various kinds of searches.  The content
of the agenda doesn't just show you the resuts of your search, it also
gives you the means to quickly view or jump to any of the "found" headings,
as well as providing a means to remotely edit them, i.e., effect changes in 
the original buffer by making changes in the agenda.

Here is how the Org-mode manual introduces the agenda:
-----------------------------------------
"Due to the way Org works, TODO items, time-stamped items, 
and tagged headlines can be scattered throughout a file or
 even a number of files. To get an overview of open action 
items, or of events that are important for a particular 
date, this information must be collected, sorted and 
displayed in an organized way."

"Org can select items based on various criteria and display
them in a separate buffer. Seven different view types 
are provided:"

    "-  an agenda that is like a calendar and shows 
       information for specific dates,
    -  a TODO list that covers all unfinished action items,
    -  a match view, showings headlines based on the tags, 
       properties, and TODO state associated with them,
    -  a timeline view that shows all events in a single
       Org file, in time-sorted view,
    [. . .]
    -  custom views that are special searches and 
       combinations of different views." 
from http://orgmode.org/manual/Agenda-Views.html#Agenda-Views
------------------------------------------

VimOrganizer currently supports versions of the 
above-mentioned agenda views, doesn't yet support the
'text search view' or the 'stuck projects view'.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Agenda files                                  *vimorg-agenda-files*

When VimOrganizer runs a search to generate an agenda view, it searches
files that are included in the 'agenda files' list.  If a file in agenda
files list has not yet been loaded, it will be loaded as part of the 
search.

The variable, g:agenda_files holds the list of agenda files.  
You can enter values for g:agenda_files in your vimrc, e.g.,

    :let g:agenda_files = ['c:/path/myfile1.org','c:/path/myfile2.org']
   
There is a bare-bones agenda-editing mechanism that works like this:

   (1) Put your .org working directories in list g:agenda_dirs.  Mine is in my
vimrc and includes a single directory:

    :let g:agenda_dirs=["c:/users/herbert/documents/org-files"]
   
   (2) Then to edit your agenda files issue this command 
   
        :EditAgendaFiles
   
   This will open a new tab and show your current agenda files along with a list
   of all org files in your agenda dirs.  Simply copy or move files from the 
   agenda dirs list to the top and when done press :W (that's a capital 'W'). 
   
You can also use Vimscript to add files to g:agenda_files.  For
example, putting something like the following lines in your vimrc would
always fill g:agenda_files upon startup:

   let g:agenda_files = split(glob("~/documents/org_files/*.org"),"\n")

HINT: use the '+=' operator if you want to append these entries to those
already in g:agenda_files. E.g.,

   let g:agenda_files += split(glob("~/documents/org_files/*.org"),"\n")

----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Agenda Dashboard                              *vimorg-agenda-dashboard*

The agenda_dashboard provides a user-interface for issuing different
kinds of agenda searches.  Below is a list of the different commands
you can issue from the dashboard:

     a     This will search agenda files for headings with dates
           that fall in the current week.  The resulting agenda allows
           you to issue more commands to change the view:

                    vd, vw, vm, vy  -- Sets view period.  The 'a'
                                       command always starts with 
                                       a week view, but you can change
                                       it to show single day (vd), 
                                       single month (vm), or year (vy).
                    [<num>]f, [<num>]b  -- forward and backward to next
                                       or previous view period.  Optional
                                       number prefix to specify number
                                       of periods to jump.  E.g., issuing
                                       3f when view is a month view
                                       of August 2011 would jump forward
                                       three months and show month view 
                                       of November 2011.

     t     Assembles a list of headings marked as todo items.  Top line
           of agenda provides menu that allows you to press a number
           to rerun the search limiting results to certain todo items.
           UNFINISHED_TODOS will match whichever tags are before the '|'
           in a buffer's todo spec, so may match multiple TODO items.
           Likewise, FINISHED_TODOS will match whichever todos occur 
           _after_ the '|' in a buffer's todo setup.  

     m     Tags/TODO/Property match. Prompts you for a search 
           specification in command line and retrieves headings
           with matching metadata. See |vimorg-tags-search| .


--------------------------------------------------------------------
Keys in the Agenda                             *vimorg-agenda-keys*

Some keys have special operation in the Agenda:

      <enter>    -- pressing <enter> on a heading in agenda
                    will (1) switch (if necessary) to show
                    the chosen heading's buffer in window
                    above the agenda, (2) fully fold the 
                    heading's entire buffer, and (3) position
                    buffer at heading and unfold the chosen
                    heading.  The cursor remains in the agenda
                    but you can see the synched heading in
                    window above.
      <ctl-enter> - Will stay in the Agenda's window and 
                    switch to the chosen heading's buffer
                    with cursor positioned at heading.
      <tab>       - will toggle heading's text immediately
                    underneath the heading line in agenda.
      <shift-tab> - Will cycle through the heading's todo
                    items, simultaneously also changing the 
                    heading in its original buffer.  The
                    cycling is smart enough to use the todo
                    setup of each original buffer, so 
                    different headings in agenda may cycle
                    different todo items.
      q           - close agenda window
      r           - rerun the search, in case you have
                    changed data and want to get new
                    view.  Will use dates and view of the
                    results currently showing in the fifth
                    line of the agenda, including a filter
                    specification, which may be changed
                    before refreshing.  For example, to
                    refresh agenda to show only unfinished
                    todo items, change text after 'FILTER:'
                    to be +UNFINISHED_TODOS.
     ,d             Invokes the date dashboard, allowing you
                    to remotely edit or add to the heading's dates
                    in the original buffer.
---------------------------------------------------------------
Tags/TODO/Property search                  *vimorg-tags-search*

           You can enter a tags/todo search that will search 
           various various parts of each heading's metadata 
           and return the results in the agenda.  
           Here are some examples that
           illustrate the syntax:

                Enter search string: +work
                     selects headlines tagged ':work:'

                Enter search string: +work-boss
                     selects headlines tagged ':work:', but 
                     excludes those also tagged ':boss:'.

                Enter search string: +work|+boss  (or just work|boss)
                     selects headlines tagged ':work:' or ':boss:'

                Enter search string: +work|+laptop+night
                     selects headlines tagged ':work:' or 
                     both ':laptop:' and ':night:'

          The examples above are search tags, but you can include
          searches for todo items in the same way:

                Enter search string: +work+TODO
                     selects headlines tagged ':work:' that
                     are marked with 'TODO' status.
                     (e.g., * TODO My work item
                              :work:                  )

                Enter search string: +work+DONE
                     selects headlines tagged ':work:' that
                     are marked with 'DONE' status.
                     (e.g., * DONE My work item
                              :work:                  )
 
           Instead of a tag, you may also specify a regular expression enclosed
           in curly braces. For example:

                Enter search string: +work+{boss.*}
                    selects headlines that contain the tag ':work:'
                    and any tag starting with :boss. (Note: unlike
                    the similar search in Org-mode, there should be
                    _no_ initial '^'.) 

           You may also search for properties at the search string.  Properties
           may be ones you have entered yourself ( see |vimorg-properties| ) or
           one of a set of special properties that all headings have.  E.g.,
           'LEVEL' is a built-in property that indicates the outline level of a
           heading, so you could do this:

                Enter search string: +work+LEVEL=2
                     selects headlines at level 2 that are
                     also tagged ':work:'

           Here is an example of a complex search string, which assumes 
           the user has entered a 'WITH' property and an 'EFFORT'
           property for some headings:

          +work-boss+EFFORT<2+WITH={Sarah\|George}+DEADLINE>="2011-11-13"
 
          The type of comparison done depends on how the comparison value is written:

          - If the comparison value is a plain number, a numerical comparison is
            done, and the allowed operators are <, =, >, <=, >=, and
            !=. 
          - If the comparison value is enclosed in double-quotes, a string
            comparison is done, and the same operators are allowed.  
          - If the comparison value is enclosed in double-quotes and angular
            brackets (like DEADLINE<="<2008-12-24 18:30>"), both values are
            assumed to be date/time specifications in the standard way, 
            and the comparison will be done accordingly. 
          - If the comparison value is enclosed in curly braces, a regexp match
            is performed, with = meaning that the regexp matches the property
            value, and != meaning that it does not match. 
==============================================================================
Column view                                              *vimorg-column-view*

Column view in VimOrganizer is similar to the feature having the same name
in Org-mode, but different in important ways. At its core it simply offers
a way to reveal data about a heading when it is displayed as a fold.
Folded heading lines in Vim are not directly editable.  (A user interface
to allow easy editing of columns/properties is on VimOrganizer's todo list.)

The default display in VimOrganizer (i.e., colmns off) merely shows the 
number of lines in a fold along the right margin.  Column view can be turned 
on or off in each buffer, but to make each buffer default to on you can place
this line in your vimrc:

        let g:global_column_view = 1

Specification of COLUMNS is similar to Org-mode, except that ITEM is
always included, although length settings for ITEM are always ignored.
This is because the ITEM display is automatically truncated to make
space for the other columns, and ITEM will automatically expand or
contract if you resize the Vim window.  The column definition string 
format is identical to that used by Org-mode, although the optional
'summary-type' attribute is currently ignored in VimOrganizer. See: 
http://orgmode.org/manual/Defining-columns.html#Defining-columns

The built-in global default for column view is to show any TAGS flush
left in a 35 character column.  You can modify that be setting a global 
default in your vimrc.  The built-in default would look like this:

        let g:global_column_defaults = '%ITEM %35TAGS'

A default that would show the DEADLINE value in addition to TAGS might
look like this:

        let g:global_column_defaults = '%ITEM %15DEADLINE %30TAGS'

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Columns Dashboard                                   *vimorg-columns-dashboard*

You can access the column dashboard by pressing ,m or by entering the command 
:OrgColumns.  The dashboard shows you the current relevant settings and
allows you to change them:

    buffer default columns -- these defaults are taken either
                              from the global defaults, or from the
                              settings in a columns configuration

                               ON even if column view is OFF.

    Operations on dashboard
    -----------------------
           f    --- force all of buffer to use settings.  If
                    not chosen then (1) only the current subtree will be
                    placed into column, or (2) entire buffer
                    will be in column view if cursor is in 
                    front of the first heading in the document.
           r    --- revert to buffer defaults, if defaults have
                    been changed
           t    --- toggle column view ON/OFF
           h    --- toggle column headings ON/OFF
           l    --- toggle line count ON/OFF
     
                                          *org_columns_custom_list*
     Custom column options will then be listed.  If no custom options have
     been assigned in the vimrc, then built-in behavior is to have two 
     options as if the user had the line below in their vimrc.  This line
     defines a list have two custom column strings, one having a 
     DEADLINE and a TAGS column, the second having just a DEADLINE column:

          let *g:org_custom_column_options* = ['%ITEM %14DEADLINE %30TAGS',
                           \ '%ITEM %14DEADLINE']

     g:org_custom_column_options is a list containing column format
     strings.  Each format string will be listed on the dashboard
     with a number in front of it, and can be accessed by pressing
     the key for that number (0-9).  The format strings are constructed of
     pairs of 'metadata field,format for field' with additional pairs 
     also separated by commas.  The format options used are the same as those
     of the |printf| function, which is used to format the columns internally.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
COLUMNS config line                       *vimorg-columns-config-line* 

    Any document may have a line that sets the default column settings
    for the document.  This will override any global default that has been
    set.  The format allows for a single string, with settings like
    those described above for g:org_custom_column_options.  An example
    COLUMNS config would look like this.  Note that the '#' must be in the
    leftmost column of the text:

#+COLUMNS: DEADLINE,%-14s,TAGS,%-30s

---------------------------------------------------------------------
COLUMNS property                                 *vimorg-columns-property*

Columns properties work like how they work in Org-mode.  You can set
a COLUMNS property in the property block of a heading.  That setting
will (1) override any default or custom settings for the buffer (unless
you enter a buffer-wide columns mode with cursor not on the heading), and
(2) be inherited by subheadings of of that heading.  (Also, you
can force entire buffer to use a headings COLUMNS property by
choosing 'f' on columns dashboard.)  For example, entering columns
mode withe the cursor on 'Heading One' below below would display 
folded lines with just a DEADLINE column, regardless of what the 
settings were in the rest of the document:

       * Heading One
         :PROPERTIES:
         :COLUMNS: %ITEM %14DEADLINE
         :END:
       ** Subhead One
          Text for Subhead One
       ** Subhead Two
          Some text for Subhead Two

VimOrganizer Export                                  *vimorg-export*
                                                     *vimorg-print*
                                                     *vimorg-export-to-html*
                                                     *vimorg-export-to-pdf*

VimOrganizer calls out to Org-mode in Emacs for all exports.  To print
a VimOrganizer file the recommended method is to export to a format that
is better for printing.

The Export Dashboard can be opened from the menu in gvim ('Export/Publish')
or with the key mapping |,x| .
The VimOrganizer Export Dashboard is similar to Org-mode's export
dispatcher, and the best way to learn about it is to read the Org-mode 
documentation:
http://orgmode.org/manual/Exporting.html#Exporting

                                              *vimorg-export-microsoft-word*
                                              *vimorg-export-opendocument*
                                              *vimorg-export-openoffice*
                                              *vimorg-export-docx*
The Export Dashboard includes an option for export to OpenDocument
format.  This option creates an odt document that can then be 
edited by (recent version) of Microsoft Word or OpenOffice.  
Once into Word, OpenOffice, or LibreOffice the document can 
be saved as a .doc or .docx file.
Export of items into odt supports objects like images, tables,
and footnotes in addition to highlighting and other simple formatting.  
The odt export currently (November 2011) requires special configuration
of your Emacs install.  Instructions are here:
http://orgmode.org/manual/OpenDocumentText-export.html#OpenDocumentText-export

                                              *vimorg-publishing*
As in Org-mode, VimOrganizer's Export Dashboard also includes
options for "publishing" a project.  A "project" is a set of
related documents that you set up to be automatically exported
together, which is called "publishing" the project.  The
publishing options on the VimOrganizer's Export Dashboard 
simply call Emacs to process files so the Org-mode documentation for 
publishing is best way to learn about them.  Setting up a project
requires some fairly simple configuration using lisp statements
added to the .emacs file, which is Emacs' counterpart to Vim's vimrc:
http://orgmode.org/manual/Publishing.html#Publishing

                                              *vimorg-tangling*
                                              *vimorg-literate-programming*
Another option on the Export Dashboard is 'tangle'.  This operation
extracts source code blocks from an org document and saves them so
they're in format that can be (1) executed by an interpreter or 
(2) compiled, depending on the source block language.  This provides
a way to use VimOrganizer as an editor for 'literate programming'.
See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming
Documentation for tangling can be found in Org-mode's manual:
http://orgmode.org/manual/Extracting-source-code.html#Extracting-source-code

                                                 *vimorg-export-options*
Finally, one option on the Export Dashboard simply inserts a template
of option lines into your document.  This template can be inserted anywhere
in your document, but is typically placed at the very beginning.  It 
provides a default set of export-related options that you can modify 
as you wish.  For more information on all the options see this page:
http://orgmode.org/manual/Export-options.html#Export-options
