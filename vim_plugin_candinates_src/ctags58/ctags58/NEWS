  that running ctags on preprocessor output can generate line numbers and file
  names which correspond to the original source files.
* Added -V option to enable verbose message for each file considered.
* Added special handling for macros of form "INIT(= value)".
* Added ability to suffix an ignored identifier (-I option) with the '+'
  character, thus instructing ctags to also ignore any argument list which
  may follow the identifier.
* Changed the -i option, moving Java language options to the new --java-types
  option. The -i option is now deprecated in favor of the new language
  specific tag type options.
* Changed behavior of handling of ignored identifiers (-I option) to still
  generate a tag for any macro definition for that identifier.
* Changed handling of -h option so that include files are no longer assumed to
  be C++ files.

* Directories named "SCCS" are skipped when using the -R or --recurse option
  under Unix.
* Fixed porting problems [HP-UX, IRIX, SunOS, MSDOS/Windows].

ctags-2.2 (Mon Jul 20 1998)
* Added the --recurse and -R options to allow recursing into directories.
  This allows running ctags on an entire source directory tree using the
  single command "ctags -R <dir>". Currently, this option is only supported on
  UNIX, MSDOS, Windows 95/NT, and OS/2. Other platforms will have to wait.
* Changed writing of Emacs-style TAGS file to binary mode [MSDOS/Windows].
* Fixed porting problems [HP-UX, OSF/1].

  automatic detection of the language (i.e. recognized keywords) based upon
  the file extension.
* Added the --lang option for manually overriding the automatic selection of
  the language.
* Added new flag 'i' to the -i option to allow generating tags for Java
  interfaces.

  namespaces.
* Added new flag 'x' to the -i option to allow generating tags for extern
  variable declarations.
* Added new extension flags, "private", "protected", and "public", which
  indicate the visibility of class members when it can be determined.
* Changed behavior of flag 'C' of the -i option to add tags of form
  "class.member" for Java.
* Changed how files on command line are handled. Ctags will now only scan
  those files whose extensions it knows about unless the --lang option is
  specified. This allows running ctags on all files in a directory without
  having to be specific (e.g. "ctags *").
* Removed support for duplicate tag warnings and the -w and -W options. These
  options are silently ignored for now.

ctags-2.0.4 (Sat May 23 1998)
* Added sorting time to the output of the --totals option.
* Added the --keywords option to allow restricting the recognized
  declaration keywords in order to handle legacy source code which uses

* Added stripping of installed binary for "install" target.

ctags-2.0.1 (Thu Feb 19 1998)
* Added support for C++.
* Added new flag 'F' to the -i option to allow adding an extra tag for the
  basename of each source file supplied to ctags. This provides the ability to
  jump to a source file in Vi using ":tag file.c".
* Added new flag 'm' to generate tags for class, structure, and union members
  (disabled by default).
* Added several new flags to the -i option to allow finer specification of
  which types of tags to include/exclude.
* Added ".hh" extension to the default list of files recognized as header
  files.
* Added explicit handling of special gcc construct __attribute((..)),
  which could lead to incorrect tag generation.
* Added configure option --disable-extended-format to allow building ctags
  with the extended format disabled by default.
* Added configure option --enable-macro-patterns to change the default
  behavior of ctags to generate patterns instead of line numbers for macro
  (define) tags.
* Changed configure option --enable-internal-sort to --disable-external-sort.
* Changed makefile for OS/2.
* Removed support for the -d, -t and -T options which had been deprecated
  for some time.
* Removed ANNOUNCE file in distribution, consolidating it with the README
  file.
* Replaced CHANGES file with NEWS for more GNU-like standard distribution.
* Improved the detection of macros of the type generated by Microsoft Visual C
  when generating source code. These caused subsequent statements to fail to
  have tags generated for them. Still not bullet proof, though.
* Fixed a problem which prevented the use of / as a path separator under MSDOS
  and Win 95/NT.
* Fixed problem of blank lines occuring in the tag file.
* Fixed recognition of declarations with parentheses.
* Fixed problem of missing tags for objects within extern "C" blocks.
* Fixed problem in source file counts when using --totals option.
* Extended the length of tag type field in -x output to be more verbose.
* Fixed option initialization error which caused static tags to be excluded.

ctags-1.7 (Mon Oct 13 1997)
* Tag files now use a new extended format which is backwards compatible with
  existing Vi implementations, yet provides extended information which can be
  used by supporting editors.
* Added documentation pseudo-tags (e.g. !_TAG_FILE_FORMAT) to tag file.
* Added the --excmd option as alternative to the -n and -N options.
* Added the --format option to allow forcing the old-style tag file format.
* Added the --if0 to control how "#if 0" branches are handled.
* Added the --sort option as alternative to -u option.
* Added the --totals option to print statistics of tag generation.
* Added the --version option.
* Improved handling of preprocessor conditionals.
* Code within an #if 0 is now never scanned for non-macro tags by default
  since tags within that code could conceivably be overridden by more
  desirable tags in the #else branch to follow. Macro tags in these branches
  are always included.
* Fixed problem which could leave invalid tag entries in tag file when an
  internal re-scan of a source file occurred.
* Fixed problem with internal sort mechanism when appending tags to existing
  file.
* Changed external sort command to filter out duplicate identical tags lines
  (including the pattern) unless warnings for duplicate tags are enabled.
* Added data to emacs style tag entries to more closely match that produced by
  the GNU etags.
* Removed fixed limits on maximum tag line length.
* Correction to Amiga makefile.
* Improvements to Win32 portability with changes to Makefile.w32.

ctags-1.6 (Tue May 13 1997)
* Now using GNU autoconf to permit automatic host configuration.
* Added the -e option to generate Emacs style tag files
* Added ETAGS environment variable to be used when -e option is in effect.
* Added the -p option to supply a default path for source files.
* Fixed problem of incorrect line numbers in tag file when form feeds and
  vertical tabs occured in the source file.
* Fixed problem preventing ignoring of identifiers specified via the -I option
  when the identifiers were followed by a parameter list in the source code.
* Changed the search patterns generated for #define macros when using -N
  option. It now includes the character following the name (or "$" if end of
  line) instead of the "\>" used previously. Some editors did not support this
  metacharacter for tag searches.
* Removed -u (unique) flag from sort command line invocation to retain exactly
  indentical tag patterns in the same file. This is in preparation for editor
  support of duplicate tags.
* Fixed problem resulting in no tags generated following a function-like
  macro reference outside of a function block.
* Fixed problem of no tags generated for typedef for function or function
  pointer.
* Fixed problem of no tags generated after encountering strange function
  declarations (e.g. "foo(params) saywhat (void);")

ctags-1.5 (Sat Oct 5 1996)
* Added generation of tags for objects inside C++ extern blocks (e.g.
  'extern "C" {...}' construct).
* Added generation of tags for function definitions inside brace-enclosed
  ("{}") blocks, since function definitions are allowed inside classes and
  extern blocks.
* Added the -N option to force patterns to be used for all tags (including
  macro tags).
* Changed the search patterns generated for macro definitions to be terminated
  with "\>", which allows the pattern to still match even when the #define
  line beyond the macro name is changed.
* Fixed problem resulting in no tags generated for files containing a
  function-like macro, such as 'MODULE_ID("$Id")', even when ignoring the
  keyword. This also fixed a problem that caused tags to be missed for
  initialized function pointer definitions.
* Redirected error messages to stdout for MSDOS version.

ctags-1.4 (Sun Aug 18 1996)
* Added recursive parsing of class/struct/enum blocks to look for
  class/struct/enum tags and enumeration values.
* Added the -I option to specify keywords to ignore in the source files.
* Fixed problem resulting in no tag generated when declaring a pointer const
  or volatile.
* Fixed problem resulting in no tag generated for comma terminated function
  declarations.

ctags-1.3 (Sun Jun 16 1996)
* Fixed problem problem which caused "struct tag;" to be misinterpreted as a
  variable definition.
* Added the -n option to use line numbers in the tag file instead of patterns.
* Added the -? option as an alternative for the --help option.

ctags-1.2 (Wed Jun 5 1996)
* Fixed a problem caused by an unitialized variable.

ctags-1.1 (Tue Jun 4 1996)
* Fixed problem reading parameter list to the -h option.

ctags-1.0a (Mon Jun 3 1996)
* Added ctags.lsm to distribution
