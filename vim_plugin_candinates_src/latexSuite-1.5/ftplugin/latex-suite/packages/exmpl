" This variable creates Options submenu in package menu. Even when no options are
" given for this package it HAS to exist in form
" let TeX_package_option_exmpl = ""
" Options and commands are delimited with comma ,

let g:TeX_package_option_exmpl = "OpcjaA=,OpcjaB,OpcjaC"

" Most command should have some definition before. Package menu system can
" recognize type of command and behave in good manner:
" env: (environment) creates simple environment template
"   \begin{command}
"     x          <- cursor here
"   \end{command}  
" 
" bra: (brackets) useful when inserting brackets commands
"   \command{x}<<>> <- cursor at x, and placeholders as in other menu entries
"
" nor: (normal)             nor: and pla: are `highlighted' in menu with `''
"   \command<Space>
"
" pla: (plain)
"   command<Space>
" 
" spe: (special)
"   command   <-literal insertion of command, in future here should go
"               commands with special characters
" 
" sep: (separator) creates separator. Good for aesthetics and usability :)
"   
" Command can be also given with no prefix:. The result is
"   \command   (as in nor: but without <Space>)
