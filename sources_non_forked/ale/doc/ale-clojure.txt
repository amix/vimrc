Joker is a small Clojure interpreter and linter written in Go.

https://github.com/candid82/joker

Linting options are not configurable by ale, but instead are controlled by a
`.joker` file in same directory as the file (or current working directory if
linting stdin), a parent directory relative to the file, or the users home
directory.

see https://github.com/candid82/joker#linter-mode for more information.
