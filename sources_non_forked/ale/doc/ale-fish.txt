ALE Fish Integration                                         *ale-fish-options*

Lints fish files using `fish -n`.

Note that `fish -n` is not foolproof: it sometimes gives false positives or
errors that are difficult to parse without more context. This integration skips
displaying errors if an error message is not found.

If ALE is not showing any errors but your file does not run as expected, run
`fish -n <file.fish>` from the command line.
