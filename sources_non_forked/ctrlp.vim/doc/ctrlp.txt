Detailed descriptions and default values:~

                                                                *'g:ctrlp_map'*
Use this option to change the mapping to invoke CtrlP in |Normal| mode: >
  let g:ctrlp_map = '<c-p>'
<

                                                                *'g:ctrlp_cmd'*
Set the default opening command to use when pressing the above mapping: >
  let g:ctrlp_cmd = 'CtrlP'
<

                                                             *'g:loaded_ctrlp'*
Use this to disable the plugin completely: >
  let g:loaded_ctrlp = 1
<

                                                        *'g:ctrlp_by_filename'*
Set this to 1 to set searching by filename (as opposed to full path) as the
default: >
  let g:ctrlp_by_filename = 0
<
Can be toggled on/off by pressing <c-d> inside the prompt.

                                                             *'g:ctrlp_regexp'*
Set this to 1 to set regexp search as the default: >
  let g:ctrlp_regexp = 0
<
Can be toggled on/off by pressing <c-r> inside the prompt.

                                                       *'g:ctrlp_match_window'*
Change the position, the listing order of results, the minimum and the maximum
heights of the match window: >
  let g:ctrlp_match_window = ''
<
Example: >
  let g:ctrlp_match_window = 'bottom,order:btt,min:1,max:10,results:10'
<
The position: (default: bottom)
  top - show the match window at the top of the screen.
  bottom - show the match window at the bottom of the screen.

The listing order of results: (default: btt)
  order:ttb - from top to bottom.
  order:btt - from bottom to top.

The minimum and maximum heights:
  min:{n} - show minimum {n} lines (default: 1).
  max:{n} - show maximum {n} lines (default: 10).

The maximum number of results:
  results:{n} - list maximum {n} results (default: sync with max height).
                0 mean no-limit.

Note: When a setting isn't set, its default value will be used.

                                                      *'g:ctrlp_switch_buffer'*
When opening a file, if it's already open in a window somewhere, CtrlP will try
to jump to it instead of opening a new instance: >
  let g:ctrlp_switch_buffer = 'Et'
<
  e - jump when <cr> is pressed, but only to windows in the current tab.
  t - jump when <c-t> is pressed, but only to windows in another tab.
  v - like "e", but jump when <c-v> is pressed.
  h - like "e", but jump when <c-x> is pressed.
  E, T, V, H - like "e", "t", "v", and "h", but jump to windows anywhere.
  0 or <empty> - disable this feature.

                                                       *'g:ctrlp_reuse_window'*
When opening a file with <cr>, CtrlP avoids opening it in windows created by
plugins, help and quickfix. Use this to setup some exceptions: >
  let g:ctrlp_reuse_window = 'netrw'
<
Acceptable values are partial name, filetype or buftype of the special buffers.
Use regexp to specify the pattern.
Example: >
  let g:ctrlp_reuse_window = 'netrw\|help\|quickfix'
<

                                                   *'g:ctrlp_tabpage_position'*
Where to put the new tab page when opening one: >
  let g:ctrlp_tabpage_position = 'ac'
<
  a - after.
  b - before.
  c - the current tab page.
  l - the last tab page.
  f - the first tab page.

                                                  *'g:ctrlp_working_path_mode'*
When starting up, CtrlP sets its local working directory according to this
variable: >
  let g:ctrlp_working_path_mode = 'ra'
<
  c - the directory of the current file.
  a - the directory of the current file, unless it is a subdirectory of the cwd
  r - the nearest ancestor of the current file that contains one of these
      directories or files:
      .git .hg .svn .bzr _darcs
  w - modifier to "r": start search from the cwd instead of the current file's
      directory
  0 or <empty> - disable this feature.

Note #1: if "a" or "c" is included with "r", use the behavior of "a" or "c" (as
a fallback) when a root can't be found.

Note #2: you can use a |b:var| to set this option on a per buffer basis.

                                                       *'g:ctrlp_root_markers'*
Use this to set your own root markers in addition to the default ones (.git,
.hg, .svn, .bzr, and _darcs). Your markers will take precedence: >
  let g:ctrlp_root_markers = ['']
<
Note: you can use a |b:var| to set this option on a per buffer basis.

                                                        *'g:ctrlp_use_caching'*
Enable/Disable per-session caching: >
  let g:ctrlp_use_caching = 1
<
  0 - Disable caching.
  1 - Enable caching.
  n - When bigger than 1, disable caching and use the number as the limit to
      enable caching again.

Note: you can quickly purge the cache by pressing <F5> while inside CtrlP.

                                                *'g:ctrlp_clear_cache_on_exit'*
Set this to 0 to enable cross-session caching by not deleting the cache files
upon exiting Vim: >
  let g:ctrlp_clear_cache_on_exit = 1
<

                                                          *'g:ctrlp_cache_dir'*
Set the directory to store the cache files: >
  let g:ctrlp_cache_dir = $HOME.'/.cache/ctrlp'
<

                                                        *'g:ctrlp_show_hidden'*
Set this to 1 if you want CtrlP to scan for dotfiles and dotdirs: >
  let g:ctrlp_show_hidden = 0
<
Note: does not apply when a command defined with |g:ctrlp_user_command| is
being used.

                                                           *'ctrlp-wildignore'*
You can use Vim's |'wildignore'| to exclude files and directories from the
results.
Examples: >
  " Excluding version control directories
  set wildignore+=*/.git/*,*/.hg/*,*/.svn/*        " Linux/MacOSX
  set wildignore+=*\\.git\\*,*\\.hg\\*,*\\.svn\\*  " Windows ('noshellslash')
<
Note #1: the `*/` in front of each directory glob is required.

Note #2: |wildignore| influences the result of |expand()|, |globpath()| and
|glob()| which many plugins use to find stuff on the system (e.g. VCS related
plugins look for .git/, .hg/,... some other plugins look for external *.exe
tools on Windows). So be a little mindful of what you put in your |wildignore|.

                                                      *'g:ctrlp_custom_ignore'*
In addition to |'wildignore'| and |g:ctrlp_show_hidden|, use this for files
and directories you want only CtrlP to not show. Use regexp to specify the
patterns: >
  let g:ctrlp_custom_ignore = ''
<
Examples: >
  let g:ctrlp_custom_ignore = '\v[\/]\.(git|hg|svn)$'
  let g:ctrlp_custom_ignore = {
    \ 'dir':  '\v[\/]\.(git|hg|svn)$',
    \ 'file': '\v\.(exe|so|dll)$',
    \ 'link': 'SOME_BAD_SYMBOLIC_LINKS',
    \ }
  let g:ctrlp_custom_ignore = {
    \ 'file': '\v(\.cpp|\.h|\.hh|\.cxx)@<!$'
    \ }
  let g:ctrlp_custom_ignore = {
    \ 'func': 'some#custom#match_function'
    \ }
<
Note #1: by default, |wildignore| and |g:ctrlp_custom_ignore| only apply when
|globpath()| is used to scan for files, thus these options do not apply when a
command defined with |g:ctrlp_user_command| is being used.

Note #2: when changing the option's variable type, remember to |:unlet| it
first or restart Vim to avoid the "E706: Variable type mismatch" error.

Note #3: when using the "func" ignore type, you must provide the full name of
a function that can be called from CtrlP. An |autoload| function name is
recommended here. The function must take 2 parameters, the item to match and
its type. The type will be "dir", "file", or "link". The function must return
1 if the item should be ignored, 0 otherwise.

                                                          *'g:ctrlp_max_files'*
The maximum number of files to scan, set to 0 for no limit: >
  let g:ctrlp_max_files = 10000
<
Note: does not apply when a command defined with |g:ctrlp_user_command| is
being used.

                                                          *'g:ctrlp_max_depth'*
The maximum depth of a directory tree to recurse into: >
  let g:ctrlp_max_depth = 40
<
Note: does not apply when a command defined with |g:ctrlp_user_command| is
being used.

                                                       *'g:ctrlp_user_command'*
Specify an external tool to use for listing files instead of using Vim's
|globpath()|. Use %s in place of the target directory: >
  let g:ctrlp_user_command = ''
<
Examples: >
  let g:ctrlp_user_command = 'find %s -type f'       " MacOSX/Linux
  let g:ctrlp_user_command = 'dir %s /-n /b /s /a-d' " Windows
<
You can also use 'grep', 'findstr' or something else to filter the results.
Examples: >
  let g:ctrlp_user_command =
    \ 'find %s -type f | grep -v -P "\.jpg$|/tmp/"'          " MacOSX/Linux
  let g:ctrlp_user_command =
    \ 'dir %s /-n /b /s /a-d | findstr /v /l ".jpg \\tmp\\"' " Windows
<
Use a version control listing command when inside a repository, this is faster
when scanning large projects: >
  let g:ctrlp_user_command = [root_marker, listing_command, fallback_command]
  let g:ctrlp_user_command = {
    \ 'types': {
      \ 1: [root_marker_1, listing_command_1],
      \ n: [root_marker_n, listing_command_n],
      \ },
    \ 'fallback': fallback_command,
    \ 'ignore': 0 or 1
    \ }
<
Some examples: >
  " Single VCS, listing command does not list untracked files:
  let g:ctrlp_user_command = ['.git', 'cd %s && git ls-files']
  let g:ctrlp_user_command = ['.hg', 'hg --cwd %s locate -I .']

  " Multiple VCS's:
  let g:ctrlp_user_command = {
    \ 'types': {
      \ 1: ['.git', 'cd %s && git ls-files'],
      \ 2: ['.hg', 'hg --cwd %s locate -I .'],
      \ },
    \ 'fallback': 'find %s -type f'
    \ }

  " Single VCS, listing command lists untracked files (slower):
  let g:ctrlp_user_command =
    \ ['.git', 'cd %s && git ls-files -co --exclude-standard']

  let g:ctrlp_user_command =
    \ ['.hg', 'hg --cwd %s status -numac -I . $(hg root)'] " MacOSX/Linux

  let g:ctrlp_user_command = ['.hg', 'for /f "tokens=1" %%a in (''hg root'') '
    \ . 'do hg --cwd %s status -numac -I . %%a']           " Windows
<
Note #1: in the |Dictionary| format, 'fallback' and 'ignore' are optional. In
the |List| format, fallback_command is optional.

Note #2: if the fallback_command is empty or the 'fallback' key is not defined,
|globpath()| will then be used when scanning outside of a repository.

Note #3: unless the |Dictionary| format is used and 'ignore' is defined and set
to 1, the |wildignore| and |g:ctrlp_custom_ignore| options do not apply when
these custom commands are being used. When not present, 'ignore' is set to 0 by
default to retain the performance advantage of using external commands.

Note #4: when changing the option's variable type, remember to |:unlet| it
first or restart Vim to avoid the "E706: Variable type mismatch" error.

Note #5: you can use a |b:var| to set this option on a per buffer basis.

                                                        *'g:ctrlp_max_history'*
The maximum number of input strings you want CtrlP to remember. The default
value mirrors Vim's global |'history'| option: >
  let g:ctrlp_max_history = &history
<
Set to 0 to disable prompt's history. Browse the history with <c-n> and <c-p>.

                                                      *'g:ctrlp_open_new_file'*
Use this option to specify how the newly created file is to be opened when
pressing <c-y>: >
  let g:ctrlp_open_new_file = 'v'
<
  t - in a new tab.
  h - in a new horizontal split.
  v - in a new vertical split.
  r - in the current window.

                                                *'g:ctrlp_open_multiple_files'*
If non-zero, this will enable opening multiple files with <c-z> and <c-o>: >
  let g:ctrlp_open_multiple_files = 'v'
<
Example: >
  let g:ctrlp_open_multiple_files = '2vjr'
<
For the number:
  - If given, it'll be used as the maximum number of windows or tabs to create
    when opening the files (the rest will be opened as hidden buffers).
  - If not given, <c-o> will open all files, each in a new window or new tab.

For the letters:
  t - each file in a new tab.
  h - each file in a new horizontal split.
  v - each file in a new vertical split.
  i - all files as hidden buffers.
  j - after opening, jump to the first opened tab or window.
  r - open the first file in the current window, then the remaining files in
      new splits or new tabs depending on which of "h", "v" and "t" is also
      present.

                                                            *'g:ctrlp_arg_map'*
When this is set to 1, the <c-o> and <c-y> mappings will accept one extra key
as an argument to override their default behavior: >
  let g:ctrlp_arg_map = 0
<
Pressing <c-o> or <c-y> will then prompt for a keypress. The key can be:
  t - open in tab(s)
  h - open in horizontal split(s)
  v - open in vertical split(s)
  i - open as hidden buffers (for <c-o> only)
  c - clear the marked files (for <c-o> only)
  r - open in the current window (for <c-y> only)
  <esc>, <c-c>, <c-u> - cancel and go back to the prompt.
  <cr> - use the default behavior specified with |g:ctrlp_open_new_file| and
  |g:ctrlp_open_multiple_files|.

                                                    *'g:ctrlp_follow_symlinks'*
If non-zero, CtrlP will follow symbolic links when listing files: >
  let g:ctrlp_follow_symlinks = 0
<
  0 - don't follow symbolic links.
  1 - follow but ignore looped internal symlinks to avoid duplicates.
  2 - follow all symlinks indiscriminately.

Note: does not apply when a command defined with |g:ctrlp_user_command| is
being used.

                                                        *'g:ctrlp_lazy_update'*
Set this to 1 to enable the lazy-update feature: only update the match window
after typing's been stopped for a certain amount of time: >
  let g:ctrlp_lazy_update = 0
<
If is 1, update after 250ms. If bigger than 1, the number will be used as the
delay time in milliseconds.

Set this to 1 to enable seeding the prompt with the current file's relative
path: >
  let g:ctrlp_default_input = 0
<
Instead of 1 or 0, if the value of the option is a string, it'll be used as-is
as the default input: >
  let g:ctrlp_default_input = 'anystring'
<
This option works well together with |g:ctrlp_open_single_match|


                                                 *'g:ctrlp_match_current_file'*
Includes the current file in the match entries: >
  let g:ctrlp_match_current_file = 1

By default, the current file is excluded from the list.

Note: does not apply when |g:ctrlp_match_func| is used. 

                                                              *'g:ctrlp_types'*
Set this to list of names to customize core types: >
  let g:ctrlp_types = ['mru', 'fil']

By default, the types are: >
  let g:ctrlp_types = ['fil', 'buf', 'mru'].

                                                             *'g:ctrlp_abbrev'*
Define input abbreviations that can be expanded (either internally or visibly)
in the prompt: >
  let g:ctrlp_abbrev = {}
<
Examples: >
  let g:ctrlp_abbrev = {
    \ 'gmode': 'i',
    \ 'abbrevs': [
      \ {
        \ 'pattern': '^cd b',
        \ 'expanded': '@cd ~/.vim/bundle',
        \ 'mode': 'pfrz',
      \ },
      \ {
        \ 'pattern': '\(^@.\+\|\\\@<!:.\+\)\@<! ',
        \ 'expanded': '.\{-}',
        \ 'mode': 'pfr',
      \ },
      \ {
        \ 'pattern': '\\\@<!:.\+\zs\\\@<! ',
        \ 'expanded': '\ ',
        \ 'mode': 'pfz',
      \ },
      \ ]
    \ }
<
The 'pattern' string is regexp matched against the entered input. The expansion
is as if the 'expanded' string was typed into the prompt.

For 'gmode' (optional):
  i - expand internally (default).
  t - insert the expanded results into the prompt as you type.
  k - insert the expanded results when a non-keyword character is typed. Only
      applies when "t" is also present.

For 'mode' (of each entry; optional):
  f - only in filename mode.
  p - only in full path mode.
  r - only in regexp mode.
  z - only in fuzzy mode.
  n - only when creating a new file with <c-y> (use the expanded string in the
      new filename).
  c - only when auto-completing directory names with <tab> (expand the pattern
      immediately before doing the auto-completion).
  <empty> or not defined - always enable.

Note: the abbrev entries are evaluated in sequence, so a later entry can be
evaluated against the expanded result of a previous entry; this includes itself
when 'gmode' is "t".

                                                           *'g:ctrlp_key_loop'*
An experimental feature. Set this to 1 to enable input looping for the typing
of multi-byte characters: >
  let g:ctrlp_key_loop = 0
<
Note #1: when set, this option resets the |g:ctrlp_lazy_update| option.

Note #2: you can toggle this feature inside the prompt with a custom mapping: >
  let g:ctrlp_prompt_mappings = { 'ToggleKeyLoop()': ['<F3>'] }
<

                                                    *'g:ctrlp_prompt_mappings'*
Use this to customize the mappings inside CtrlP's prompt to your liking. You
only need to keep the lines that you've changed the values (inside []): >
  let g:ctrlp_prompt_mappings = {
    \ 'PrtBS()':              ['<bs>', '<c-]>'],

List of CtrlP modes for which CtrlP should accept an entry directly, if only
one candidate exists.

:CtrlP [starting-directory]
   Open CtrlP in find file mode.

   If no argument is given, the value of |g:ctrlp_working_path_mode| will be
   used to determine the starting directory.  See |:CtrlPCurFile| and
   |:CtrlPCurWD| to temporarily override the setting.

   You can use <tab> to auto-complete the [starting-directory] when typing it.

:CtrlPCurFile
    This acts like |:CtrlP| with |g:ctrlp_working_path_mode| = 'c' and ignores
    the variable's current value.

:CtrlPCurWD
    This acts like |:CtrlP| with |g:ctrlp_working_path_mode| = 'd' and ignores
    the variable's current value.

                                                                    *:CtrlPMRU*
:CtrlPMRU
   Open CtrlP in find Most-Recently-Used file mode.

:CtrlPLastMode [--dir]
   Open CtrlP in the last mode used. When having the "--dir" argument, also
   reuse the last working directory.

                                                                   *:CtrlPRoot*
:CtrlPRoot
    This acts like |:CtrlP| with |g:ctrlp_working_path_mode| = 'r' and ignores
    the variable's current value.

                                                             *:CtrlPClearCache*
:CtrlPClearCache
   Flush the cache for the current working directory. The same as pressing <F5>
   inside CtrlP.
   To enable or disable caching, use the |g:ctrlp_use_caching| option.

                                                         *:CtrlPClearAllCaches*

INPUT FORMATS                                             *ctrlp-input-formats*

Formats for inputting in the prompt:~

a)  Simple string.

    E.g. 'abc' is understood internally as 'a[^a]\{-}b[^b]\{-}c'

b)  When in regexp mode, the input string's treated as a Vim's regexp |pattern|
    without any modification.

    E.g. 'abc\d*efg' will be read as 'abc\d*efg'.

    See |ctrlp-fullregexp| (keymap) and |g:ctrlp_regexp_search| (option) for
    how to enable regexp mode.

c)  End the string with a colon ':' followed by a Vim command to execute that
    command after opening the file. If you need to use ':' literally, escape it
    with a backslash: '\:'. When opening multiple files, the command will be
    executed on each opening file.

    E.g. Use ':45' to jump to line 45.

         Use ':/any\:string' to jump to the first instance of 'any:string'.

         Use ':+setf\ myfiletype|50' to set the filetype to 'myfiletype', then
         jump to line 50.

         Use ':diffthis' when opening multiple files to run |:diffthis| on the
         first 4 files.

    See also: Vim's |++opt| and |+cmd|.

d)  Submit two dots '..' to go upward the directory tree by 1 level. To go up
    multiple levels, use one extra dot for each extra level:
>
         Raw input    Interpreted as
         ..           ../
         ...          ../../
         ....         ../../../
<
    Note: if the parent directories are large and uncached, this can be slow.

    You can also use '@cd path/' to change CtrlP's local working directory.
    Use '@cd %:h' to change to the directory of the current file.

e)  Similarly, submit '/' or '\' to find and go to the project's root.

    If the project is large, using a VCS listing command to look for files
    might help speeding up the initial scan (see |g:ctrlp_user_command| for more
    details).

    Note: d) and e) only work in file, directory and mixed modes.

f)  Type the name of a non-existent file and press <c-y> to create it. Mark a
    file with <c-z> to create the new file in the same directory as the marked
    file.

    E.g. Using 'newdir/newfile.txt' will create a directory named 'newdir' as
         well as a file named 'newfile.txt'.

         If an entry 'some/old/dirs/oldfile.txt' is marked with <c-z>, then
         'newdir' and 'newfile.txt' will be created under 'some/old/dirs'. The
         final path will then be 'some/old/dirs/newdir/newfile.txt'.

    Note: use '\' in place of '/' on Windows (if |'shellslash'| is not set).

g)  In filename mode (toggle with <c-d>), you can use one primary pattern and
    one refining pattern separated by a semicolon. Both patterns work like (a),
    or (b) when in regexp mode.

h)  Submit ? to open this help file.

                                                 *ctrlp-autoignore-extension*
  * Autoignore mode:~
    - Name: 'autoignore'

    - This extension doesn't add new commands. It adds support for per-project
      ignore patterns (as per |ctrlp_custom_ignore|) via a `.ctrlpignore` file
      at the root of the project. It's basically like a `.gitignore` or
      `.hgignore` for CtrlP.

      Note: auto-ignore won't work when |g:ctrlp_user_command| is used.

      Note: `.ctrlpignore` will be added to the root markers (see
      |g:ctrlp_root_markers|).

    - Ignore file syntax:
      Empty lines, and lines starting with `#` (comments) are ignored.

      Other lines are treated like regular expression patterns. See *string-match*
      for how patterns are used. Anything that matches any of the patterns will be
      ignored from CtrlP's search results.

      Example:

        \.tmp$
        ^generated/
        local\.cfg

      Note: patterns should use forward slashes, even on Windows.

      You can also switch to a glob-like syntax like this:

        syntax:wildignore
        *.tar.gz
        *.tmp

      This will temporarily add each pattern to |'wildignore'| for the
      duration of the file scan, and remove them at the end.

      You can switch back to the default regular-expression-based patterns by
      writing:

        syntax:regexp

      You can also specify a match on only a given type of item:

        dir:build
        file:foo\.txt

      This will only ignore directories with "build" in them, and files with
      "foo.txt" in them. Not files with "build" in them or vice-versa.

      Note: to ignore a root directory "build", and not _any_ directory with
      "build" in it, you can root the regex: ^build$

    - FAQ:
      Q: Why can't CtrlP support `.gitignore` or `.hgignore` natively?

      A: Those files look at first like they may contain all the patterns
      you'd want to exclude from CtrlP already. However, more often than not,
      there are some differences. Those files list patterns that should not be
      included in source-control. This includes things you want to ignore, but
      also things you may not want to: local settings, external packages and
      dependencies, etc. The author felt the trouble of supporting various
      syntaxes was too much compared to just copy/pasting a few lines. Feel
      free to contribute a patch if you disagree :)

      Q: I enabled |ctrlp-autoignore-extension|, or edited `.ctrlpignore`, but
      none of the new patterns are working. What did I do wrong?

      A: Probably nothing! CtrlP can cache search results for faster response
      times. You can hit <F5> to force it to refresh. This will use the newer
      ignore patterns if the `.ctrlpignore` file has changed, too.

Buffer Tag mode options:~

                                                   *'g:ctrlp_buftag_ctags_bin'*
If ctags isn't in your $PATH, or a ctags binary exists in either
/opt/local/bin or /usr/local/bin, us this to set its location: >
  let g:ctrlp_buftag_ctags_bin = ''
<

                                                   *'g:ctrlp_buftag_systemenc'*
Match this with your OS's encoding (not Vim's). The default value mirrors Vim's
global |'encoding'| option: >
  let g:ctrlp_buftag_systemenc = &encoding
<

                                                       *'g:ctrlp_buftag_types'*
Use this to set the arguments for ctags, jsctags... for a given filetype: >
  let g:ctrlp_buftag_types = ''
<
Examples: >
  let g:ctrlp_buftag_types = {
    \ 'erlang'     : '--language-force=erlang --erlang-types=drmf',
