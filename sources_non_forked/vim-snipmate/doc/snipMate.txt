{Vi does not have any of these features.}


==============================================================================
INSTALLATION                                           *snipMate-installation*

Of course you can use whatever tool you want.
However some features of snipMate depend on external VimL code:
tlib: tlib#input#List (providing a nice selection list)
vim-addon-mw-utils: (providing all the caching implementation)
Thus i recommend vim-addon-manager to install snipMate because this will also
fetch the dependencies for you.

The complete set of dependencies can be found in snipMate-addon-info.txt
The current VAM-plugin name for this enhanced version of snipMate is "snipMate".

==============================================================================
DESCRIPTION                                             *snipMate-description*

snipMate is an extension to Vim which allows you to store and retrieve text
snippets with placeholders in a very convenient way.

snipMate is inspired by TextMate's snippet features.

==============================================================================
RELATED WORK                                 *snipMate-related-work*

There are some alternatives:
- ultisnips (python based)
- xptemplate which is probably a much more powerful
  but also more complex
- neosnippets - which seems to be able to read snippet
files when swiching on compatible mode
- (..?)

snipmate is not perfect - however it gets its job done perfectly and gets out
of your way. So if you want to get started fast without reading too much
documentation probably snipmate is for you.

==============================================================================
USAGE (GETTING STARTED QUICKLY)                               *snipMate-usage*

Adding snippets: >
  :SnipMateOpenSnippetFiles
< all valid snippet locations will be shown in a list. Existing files are
  shown first. The list depends on Vim's |runtimepath|. Thus snipMate
  perfectly integrates with the recommended way of installing each plugin into
  its own directory which all newer plugin management solutions (VAM,
  Pathogen, Vundle, ..) propagate.

  The command will only show non existing .snippets files. See |snipMate-syntax|
  to learn about all supported files snipMate can read.

  In .snippets files you should use \t as indentation character which will
  be replaced by spaces/tabs depending on your Vim indentation settings.

  You can retab your snippet text by visually selecting it and pressing <cr>.

Using snippets: ~

  <c-r><tab>: shows a list of available snippets
  XX<tab>   : will either show a list of all snippets starting with the
              characters XX or expand the snippet if it matches a snippet name.

associating snippets and filetypes: ~

1) >
  g:snipMate.scope_aliases
< defines which snippets types are available when you edit a buffer.
  You can override the default in autoload/snipMate.vim in your .vimrc. For
  example, to add both ruby.snippets and ruby-rails.snippets for files of
  filetype='ruby', add the following to your vimrc: >
    let g:snipMate = {}
    let g:snipMate.scope_aliases = {} 
    let g:snipMate.scope_aliases['ruby'] = 'ruby,ruby-rails'

< SnipMate scopes are akin to filetypes.  Setting a scope alias as shown above
  allows multiple snippets files to be used for one filetype without actually
  changing the filetype.

2)
  set filetype to a list such as 'html.javascript' or such.

  Add this to your .vimrc to not add tabs if there is no match: >
    let g:snipMate['no_match_completion_feedkeys_chars'] = ""
<

 *snipMate-disambiguation*
What happens if multiple files or filetypes define the same snippet name or if
|multi_snip| is being used? This results in name collisions!
You'll get list of matching snippets and can choose one.

Snippets are loaded and refreshed automatically on demand.
The parsed .snippets files are cached.

in the current buffer to show a list via.

==============================================================================
SNIPPET SOURCES                                     *snipMate-snippet-sources*

snipMate is configurable.

plugin/snipMate.vim assigns three important keys:
>
  " default implementation collecting snippets by handlers
  let g:snipMate['get_snippets'] = snipMate#GetSnippets
  " default handler:
  let g:snipMateSources['default'] = snipMate#DefaultPool
  " default directories containing snippets:
  let g:snipMate['snippet_dirs'] = funcref#Function('return split(&runtimepath,",")')
<
You can override all of those settings.

You can see that the default set of snippets is determined by Vim's |rtp|.

Example 1: ~
autoload/snipMate_python_demo.vim shows how you can register additional
sources such as creating snippets on the fly representing python function
definitions found in the current file.

Example 2: ~
Add to your ~/.vimrc: For each know snippet add a second version ending in _
adding folding markers
>
	let g:commentChar = {
		\ 'vim': '"',
		\ 'c': '//',
		\ 'cpp': '//',
		\ 'sh': '#',
		\ 'python': '#'
		\}
	" url https://github.com/garbas/vim-snipmate/issues/49
	fun! AddFolding(text)
		return substitute(a:text,'\n'," ".g:commentChar[&ft]." {{{\n",1)."\n".g:commentChar[&ft]." }}}"
	endf

  fun! SnippetsWithFolding(scopes, trigger, result)
    " hacky: temporarely remove this function to prevent infinite recursion:
    call remove(g:snipMateSources, 'with_folding')
    " get list of snippets:
    let result = snipMate#GetSnippets(a:scopes, substitute(a:trigger,'_\(\*\)\?$','\1',''))
    let g:snipMateSources['with_folding'] = funcref#Function('SnippetsWithFolding')

    " add folding:
    for k in keys(result)
      let a:result[k.'_'] = map(result[k],'AddFolding(v:val)')
    endfor
  endf

  " force setting default:
  runtime plugin/snipMate.vim
  " add our own source
  let g:snipMateSources['with_folding'] = funcref#Function('SnippetsWithFolding')
<

==============================================================================
SYNTAX                                      *snippet-syntax* *snipMate-syntax*

Default snippet sources [1], you can add your own as illustrated in
|snipMate-snippet-sources|.

trigger: the snippet's name.
|rtp|  : Vim's |runtimepath| path list

one snippet per file:
  |rtp|/snippets/<filetype>/<trigger>.snippet

many snippets per file, triggers are specified in file, see below:
  |rtp|/snippets/<filetype>.snippets (RECOMMENDED)
  |rtp|/snippets/<filetype>/*.snippets


See |snipMate-disambiguation| to learn about how name collisions are handled.

Note that dotted
'filetype' syntax is supported -- e.g., you can use >

	:set ft=html.eruby syntax=sql

to activate snippets for both HTML, eRuby and sql for the current file.
See g:snipMate['get_scopes'] in plugin/snipMate.vim. However, this is not
recommended, as it can have unwanted side effects (appears to break some forms
of syntax highlighting).  Instead, set g:snipMate.scope_aliases. 
See|snipMate-usage|.

The syntax for snippets in *.snippets files is the following: >

 snippet trigger
 guard left_from_cursor='^\s*'
 	expanded text
	more expanded text

Note: the guard condition line is optional. It can be used to make a snippet available
only in some cases. the value should be a viml expression.
(This implementation may change). Only supported in *.snippets files by now.

Multiple snippets having the same name but different triggers exist?


Note that the first hard tab after the snippet trigger is required, and not
expanded in the actual snippet. The syntax for *.snippet files is the same,
only without the trigger declaration and starting indentation.

Also note that indentation within snippets must be defined using hard tabs.
They can be expanded to spaces later if desired (see |snipMate-indenting|).
You can retab a snippet by visually selecting the lines, then press <cr>.

"#" is used as a line-comment character in *.snippets files; however, they can
only be used outside of a snippet declaration. E.g.: >

 # this is a correct comment
 snippet trigger
 	expanded text
 snippet another_trigger
 	# this isn't a comment!
	expanded text
<
This should hopefully be obvious with the included syntax highlighting.

                                                               *snipMate-${#}*
Tab stops ~

By default, the cursor is placed at the end of a snippet. To specify where the
cursor is to be placed next, use "${#}", where the # is the number of the tab
stop. E.g., to place the cursor first on the id of a <div> tag, and then allow
the user to press <tab> to go to the middle of it:
 >
 snippet div
 	<div id="${1}">
		${2}
	</div>
<
                        *snipMate-placeholders* *snipMate-${#:}* *snipMate-$#*
Placeholders ~

Placeholder text can be supplied using "${#:text}", where # is the number of
the tab stop. This text then can be copied throughout the snippet using "$#",
given # is the same number as used before. So, to make a C for loop: >

 snippet for
 	for (${2:i}; $2 < ${1:count}; $1++) {
		${4}
	}

This will cause "count" to first be selected and change if the user starts
typing. When <tab> is pressed, the "i" in ${2}'s position will be selected;
all $2 variables will default to "i" and automatically be updated if the user
starts typing.
NOTE: "$#" syntax is used only for variables, not for tab stops as in TextMate.

Variables within variables are also possible. For instance: >

 snippet opt
 	<option value="${1:option}">${2:$1}</option>

Will, as usual, cause "option" to first be selected and update all the $1
variables if the user starts typing. Since one of these variables is inside of
${2}, this text will then be used as a placeholder for the next tab stop,
allowing the user to change it if he wishes.

To copy a value throughout a snippet without supplying default text, simply
use the "${#:}" construct without the text; e.g.: >

 snippet foo
 	${1:}bar$1
<                                                          *snipMate-commands*


                                          *snipMate-visual-selection-support*
There is a special placeholder called {VISUAL}. If you visually select text,
then press <tab> Vim switches to insert mode. The next snippet you'll expand
will replace {VISUAL} by the text which was selected previously

Interpolated Vim Script ~

Snippets can also contain Vim script commands that are executed (via |eval()|)
when the snippet is inserted. Commands are given inside backticks (`...`); for
TextMates's functionality, use the |system()| function. E.g.: >

 snippet date
 	`system("date +%Y-%m-%d")`

will insert the current date, assuming you are on a Unix system. Note that you
can also (and should) use |strftime()| for this example.

                                                            *snipMate-extends*
Borrowing from UltiSnips, .snippets files can also contain an extends
directive, for example: >

 extends html, javascript, css

will tell SnipMate to also read html, javascript, and css snippets.


Filename([{expr}] [, {defaultText}])             *snipMate-filename* *Filename()*

Since the current filename is used often in snippets, a default function
has been defined for it in snipMate.vim, appropriately called Filename().

With no arguments, the default filename without an extension is returned;
the first argument specifies what to place before or after the filename,
and the second argument supplies the default text to be used if the file
has not been named. "$1" in the first argument is replaced with the filename;
if you only want the filename to be returned, the first argument can be left
blank. Examples: >

 snippet filename
 	`Filename()`
 snippet filename_with_default
 	`Filename('', 'name')`
 snippet filename_foo
 	`filename('$1_foo')`

The first example returns the filename if it the file has been named, and an
empty string if it hasn't. The second returns the filename if it's been named,
and "name" if it hasn't. The third returns the filename followed by "_foo" if
it has been named, and an empty string if it hasn't.

                                                                   *multi_snip*
To specify that a snippet can have multiple matches in a *.snippets file, use
this syntax: >

 snippet trigger A description of snippet #1
 	expand this text
 snippet trigger A description of snippet #2
 	expand THIS text!

See |snipMate-disambiguation|

==============================================================================
SETTINGS                                  *snipMate-settings* *g:snips_author*

The g:snips_author string (similar to $TM_FULLNAME in TextMate) should be set
to your name; it can then be used in snippets to automatically add it. E.g.: >

 let g:snips_author = 'Hubert Farnsworth'
 snippet name
 	`g:snips_author`
<
                                     *snipMate-expandtab* *snipMate-indenting*
If you would like your snippets to be expanded using spaces instead of tabs,
just enable 'expandtab' and set 'softtabstop' to your preferred amount of
spaces. If 'softtabstop' is not set, 'shiftwidth' is used instead.

                                                           *snipMate-mappings*
The mappings snipMate uses can be customized with the |:map| commands. For
example, to change the key that triggers snippets and moves to the next
tabstop, >

	:imap <C-J> <Plug>snipMateNextOrTrigger
	:smap <C-J> <Plug>snipMateNextOrTrigger
<
The list of possible <Plug> mappings is as follows:

<Plug>snipMateNextOrTrigger	Jumps to the next tab stop or, if none exists,
				try to expand a snippet. Use in both insert
				and select modes.

<Plug>snipMateBack		Jump to the previous tab stop, if it exists.
				Use in both insert and select modes.

<Plug>snipMateShow		Show all available snippets (that start with
				the previous text, if it exists). Use in
				insert mode.

<Plug>snipMateVisual		|snipMate-visual-selection-support|

==============================================================================
FEATURES                                                   *snipMate-features*

snipMate.vim has the following features among others:
  - The syntax of snippets is very similar to TextMate's, allowing
    easy conversion.
  - The position of the snippet is kept transparently (i.e. it does not use
    markers/placeholders written to the buffer), which allows you to escape
    out of an incomplete snippet, something particularly useful in Vim.
  - Variables in snippets are updated as-you-type.
  - Snippets can have multiple matches.
  - Snippets can be out of order. For instance, in a do...while loop, the
    condition can be added before the code.
  - [New] File-based snippets are supported.
  - [New] Triggers after non-word delimiters are expanded, e.g. "foo"
    in "bar.foo".
  - [New] <shift-tab> can now be used to jump tab stops in reverse order.

==============================================================================
DISADVANTAGES                                         *snipMate-disadvantages*

snipMate.vim currently has the following disadvantages to TextMate's snippets:
    - There is no $0; the order of tab stops must be explicitly stated.
    - Placeholders within placeholders are not possible. E.g.: >

      '<div${1: id="${2:some_id}}">${3}</div>'
<
      In TextMate this would first highlight ' id="some_id"', and if
      you hit delete it would automatically skip ${2} and go to ${3}
      on the next <tab>, but if you didn't delete it it would highlight
      "some_id" first. You cannot do this in snipMate.vim.
    - Regex cannot be performed on variables, such as "${1/.*/\U&}"
    - Placeholders cannot span multiple lines.
    - Activating snippets in different scopes of the same file is
      not possible.

Perhaps some of these features will be added in a later release.
