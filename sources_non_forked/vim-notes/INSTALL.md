*Please note that the vim-notes plug-in requires my vim-misc plug-in which is separately distributed.*

Unzip the most recent ZIP archives of the [vim-notes] [download-notes] and [vim-misc] [download-misc] plug-ins inside your Vim profile directory (usually this is `~/.vim` on UNIX and `%USERPROFILE%\vimfiles` on Windows), restart Vim and execute the command `:helptags ~/.vim/doc` (use `:helptags ~\vimfiles\doc` instead on Windows).

If you prefer you can also use [Pathogen] [pathogen], [Vundle] [vundle] or a similar tool to install & update the [vim-notes] [github-notes] and [vim-misc] [github-misc] plug-ins using a local clone of the git repository.
