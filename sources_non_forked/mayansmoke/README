This is a pleasant and ergonomic light-background color scheme, designed for long hours of coding and working. The UI elements are muted without being drab, the syntax elements are colorful without being garish, and the background is relaxing without being soporific. It is of a low-enough contrast so as not to cause eye-burn, but high-enough contrast so as not to cause eye-strain. The syntax coloration offers just a little higher resolution than most, distinguishing between class names vs. functions, strings and numbers vs. other constants, etc. Many of the colors in this color scheme are drawn from Mayan murals, paintings and codices, and thus the name.

Customization:
==============

If any of the following highlights are defined (e.g., in your "~/.vimrc"), these will override the default highlight definitions:

    MayanSmokeCursorLine    (will be applied to: CursorColumn and CursorLine)
    MayanSmokeSearch        (will be applied to: Search and IncSearch)
    MayanSmokeSpecialKey    (will be applied to: SpecialKey)

For example, you can set the following in your "~/.vimrc" to select your own colors for these items:

    hi MayanSmokeCursorLine     guifg=NONE   guibg=yellow  gui=NONE
    hi MayanSmokeSearch         guifg=white  guibg=blue    gui=NONE
    hi MayanSmokeSpecialKey     guifg=NONE   guibg=green   gui=NONE

Alternatively, you can define one or more of the following values in your "~/.vimrc" to select different pre-defined levels of visibility for the above highlights:

    let g:mayansmoke_cursor_line_visibility = 0  " lower visibility
    let g:mayansmoke_cursor_line_visibility = 1  " medium visibility
    let g:mayansmoke_cursor_line_visibility = 2  " higher visibility

   let g:mayansmoke_search_visibility = 0 " low visibility
   let g:mayansmoke_search_visibility = 1 " medium visibility (default)
   let g:mayansmoke_search_visibility = 2 " high visibility
   let g:mayansmoke_search_visibility = 3 " very high visibility
   let g:mayansmoke_search_visibility = 4 " highest visibility

    let g:mayansmoke_special_key_visibility = 0  " lower visibility
    let g:mayansmoke_special_key_visibility = 1  " medium visibility
    let g:mayansmoke_special_key_visibility = 2  " higher visibility
