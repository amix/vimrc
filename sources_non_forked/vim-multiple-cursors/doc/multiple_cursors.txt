==============================================================================
1. Intro                                              *multiple-cursors-intro*

There [1] have [2] been [3] many [4] attempts [5] at bringing Sublime Text's
awesome multiple selection [6] feature into Vim, but none so far have been in
my opinion a faithful port that is simplistic to use, yet powerful and
intuitive enough for an existing Vim user. *vim-multiple-cursors* is yet
another attempt at that.

==============================================================================
2. Usage                                              *multiple-cursors-usage*

Out of the box, all you need to know is a single key CTRL-N. Pressing the key
in Normal mode highlights the current word under the cursor in Visual mode and
places a virtual cursor at the end of it. Pressing it again finds the next
ocurrence and places another virtual cursor at the end of the visual
selection. If you select multiple lines in Visual mode, pressing the key puts
a virtual cursor at every line and leaves you in Normal mode.

After you've marked all your locations with CTRL-N, you can change the visual
selection with normal Vim motion commands in Visual mode. You could go to
Normal mode by pressing v and wield your motion commands there. Single key
command to switch to Insert mode such as `c` or `s` from Visual mode or `i`,
`a`, `I`, `A` in Normal mode should work without any issues.

At any time, you can press <Esc> to exit back to regular Vim.

Two additional keys are also mapped:

CTRL-P in Visual mode will remove the current virtual cursor and go back to
the previous virtual cursor location. This is useful if you are trigger happy
with Ctrl-n and accidentally went too far.

CTRL-X in Visual mode will remove the current virtual cursor and skip to the
next virtual cursor location. This is useful if you don't want the current
selection to be a candidate to operate on later.

**NOTE**: The plugin is still somewhat buggy, if at any time you have
lingering cursors on screen, you can press CTRL-N in Normal mode and it will
remove all prior cursors before starting a new one.

==============================================================================
3. Mappings                                        *multiple-cursors-mappings* 

*g:multi_cursor_use_default_mapping* (Default: 1)

Out of the box, CTRL-N, CTRL-P, and CTRL-X are mapped by default. If you don't
like the plugin taking over your favorite key bindings, then turn off the
default with >

    let g:multi_cursor_use_default_mapping=0
<

*g:multi_cursor_next_key* (Default: "\<C-n>")
*g:multi_cursor_prev_key* (Default: "\<C-p>")
*g:multi_cursor_skip_key* (Default: "\<C-x>")
*g:multi_cursor_exit_key* (Default: "\<Esc>")
You can map the 'next', 'previous', 'skip', and 'exit' keys like the
following: >

    " Default mapping
    let g:multi_cursor_next_key="\<C-n>"
    let g:multi_cursor_prev_key="\<C-p>"
    let g:multi_cursor_skip_key="\<C-x>"
    let g:multi_cursor_exit_key="\<Esc>"
<

==============================================================================
4. Global Options                            *multiple-cursors-global-options* 

Currently there're two additional global settings one can tweak:

*g:multi_cursor_exit_from_visual_mode* (Defaut: 1)

If set to 0, then pressing |g:multi_cursor_exit_key| in Visual mode will not
quit and delete all existing cursors. This is useful if you want to press
Escape and go back to Normal mode, and still be able to operate on all the
cursors.

*g:multi_cursor_exit_from_insert_mode* (Default: 1)

If set to 0, then pressing |g:multi_cursor_exit_key| in Insert mode will not
quit and delete all existing cursors. This is useful if you want to press
Escape and go back to Normal mode, and still be able to operate on all the
cursors.

The plugin uses the highlight group `multiple_cursors_cursor` and
`multiple_cursors_visual` to highlight the virtual cursors and their visual
selections respectively. You can customize them by putting something similar
like the following in your vimrc: >

    " Default highlighting (see help :highlight and help :highlight-link)
    highlight multiple_cursors_cursor term=reverse cterm=reverse gui=reverse
    highlight link multiple_cursors_visual Visual
<

5. Issues                                            *multiple-cursors-issues* 

- Multi key commands like ciw do not work at the moment
- All user input typed before Vim is able to fan out the last operation to all
  cursors is lost. This is a implementation decision to keep the input
  perfectly synced in all locations, at the cost of potentially losing user
  input.
- Single key commands that do not terminate properly cause unexpected
  behavior. For example, if the cursor is on the first character in the buffer
  and 'b' is pressed.
- Undo behavior is unpredictable
- Performance in terminal vim degrades significantly with more cursors
- Select mode is not implemented
- Buggy when wrap is turned on
- Cursor highlighting is off. The last column on the same row as Vim's cursor
  is not highlighted incorrectly. Setting virtualedit=all might help

8. Credit                                            *multiple-cursors-credit* 

The plugin is obviously inspired by Sublime Text's awesome multiple selection
[6] feature. Some inspiration was also taken from Emac's multiple cursors [8]
implementation.
