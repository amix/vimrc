## Features

This plugin adds Go language support for Vim, with the following main features:

* Compile your package with `:GoBuild`, install it with `:GoInstall` or test it
  with `:GoTest`. Run a single test with `:GoTestFunc`).
* Quickly execute your current file(s) with `:GoRun`.
* Improved syntax highlighting and folding.
* Debug programs with integrated `delve` support with `:GoDebugStart`.
* Completion support via `gocode`.
* `gofmt` or `goimports` on save keeps the cursor position and undo history.
* Go to symbol/declaration with `:GoDef`.
* Look up documentation with `:GoDoc` or `:GoDocBrowser`.
* Easily import packages via `:GoImport`, remove them via `:GoDrop`.
* Precise type-safe renaming of identifiers with `:GoRename`.
* See which code is covered by tests with `:GoCoverage`.
* Add or remove tags on struct fields with `:GoAddTags` and `:GoRemoveTags`.
* Call `gometalinter` with `:GoMetaLinter` to invoke all possible linters
  (`golint`, `vet`, `errcheck`, `deadcode`, etc.) and put the result in the
  quickfix or location list.
* Lint your code with `:GoLint`, run your code through `:GoVet` to catch static
  errors, or make sure errors are checked with `:GoErrCheck`.
* Advanced source analysis tools utilizing `guru`, such as `:GoImplements`,
  `:GoCallees`, and `:GoReferrers`.
* ... and many more! Please see [doc/vim-go.txt](doc/vim-go.txt) for more
  information.

## Install

vim-go requires at least Vim 7.4.2009 or Neovim 0.3.1.

The [**latest stable release**](https://github.com/fatih/vim-go/releases/latest) is the
recommended version to use. If you choose to use the master branch instead,
please do so with caution; it is a _development_ branch.


vim-go follows the standard runtime path structure. Below are some helper lines
for popular package managers:

* [Vim 8 packages](http://vimhelp.appspot.com/repeat.txt.html#packages)
  * `git clone https://github.com/fatih/vim-go.git ~/.vim/pack/plugins/start/vim-go`
* [Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen)
  * `git clone https://github.com/fatih/vim-go.git ~/.vim/bundle/vim-go`
* [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)
  * `Plug 'fatih/vim-go', { 'do': ':GoUpdateBinaries' }`
* [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim)
  * `Plugin 'fatih/vim-go'`

You will also need to install all the necessary binaries. vim-go makes it easy
to install all of them by providing a command, `:GoInstallBinaries`, which will
`go get` all the required binaries.

Check out the Install section in [the documentation](doc/vim-go.txt) for more
detailed instructions (`:help go-install`).

## Usage

The full documentation can be found at [doc/vim-go.txt](doc/vim-go.txt). You can
display it from within Vim with `:help vim-go`.

Depending on your installation method, you may have to generate the plugin's
[`help tags`](http://vimhelp.appspot.com/helphelp.txt.html#%3Ahelptags)
manually (e.g. `:helptags ALL`).

We also have an [official vim-go tutorial](https://github.com/fatih/vim-go-tutorial).
