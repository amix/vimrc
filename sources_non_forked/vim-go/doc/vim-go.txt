INTRO                                                                *go-intro*

Go (golang) support for Vim. vim-go installs automatically all necessary
binaries for providing seamless Vim integration.  It comes with pre-defined
sensible settings (like auto gofmt on save), has autocomplete, snippet
support, improved syntax highlighting, go toolchain commands, etc... It's
highly customizable and each individual feature can be disabled/enabled
easily.

  * Improved Syntax highlighting, such as Functions, Operators, Methods..
  * Auto completion support via `gocode`
  * Better `gofmt` on save, keeps cursor position and doesn't break your undo
    history
  * Go to symbol/declaration with `godef`
  * Automatically import packages via `goimports`
  * Compile and `go build` your package, install it with `go install`
  * `go run` quickly your current file/files
  * Run `go test` and see any errors in quickfix window
  * Lint your code with `golint`
  * Run your code trough `go vet` to catch static errors.
  * Advanced source analysis tool with `oracle`
  * Precise type-safe renaming of identifiers with `gorename`
  * List all source files and dependencies
  * Checking with `errcheck` for unchecked errors.
  * Integrated and improved snippets. Supports `ultisnips` or `neosnippet`
  * Share your current code to play.golang.org
  * Type information about the underlying identifier
  * Tagbar support to show tags of the source code in a sidebar with `gotags`

INSTALL                                                           *go-install*

If you use pathogen, just clone it into your bundle directory: >

	$ cd ~/.vim/bundle
	$ git clone https://github.com/fatih/vim-go.git
<

For Vundle add this line to your vimrc:
>
  Plugin 'fatih/vim-go'
<
and execute `:PluginInstall` (or `:BundleInstall` for older versions of Vundle)


Please be sure all necessary binares are installed (such as `gocode`, `godef`,
`goimports`, etc..). You can easily install them with the included
|GoInstallBinaries|. Those binaries will be automatically downloaded and
installed to your `$GOBIN` environment (if not set it will use `$GOPATH/bin`).
It requires `git` and `hg` for fetching the individual Go packages.

* Autocompletion is enabled by default via `<C-x><C-o>`, to get real-time
completion (completion by type) install:
https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe or
https://github.com/Shougo/neocomplete.vim
* To get displayed source code tag informations on a sidebar install
https://github.com/majutsushi/tagbar.
* For snippet feature install:
https://github.com/SirVer/ultisnips or
https://github.com/Shougo/neosnippet.vim.

COMMANDS                                                          *go-commands*

                                                                  *:GoImport*
:GoImport [path]

    Import ensures that the provided package {path} is imported in the current
    Go buffer, using proper style and ordering.  If {path} is already being
    imported, an error will be displayed and the buffer will be untouched.

                                                                *:GoImportAs*
:GoImportAs [localname] [path]

    Same as Import, but uses a custom local name for the package.

                                                                    *:GoDrop*
:GoDrop [path]

    Remove the import line for the provided package {path}, if present in the
    current Go buffer.  If {path} is not being imported, an error will be
    displayed and the buffer will be untouched.

                                                                    *:GoLint*
:GoLint

    Run golint for the current Go file.

                                                                     *:GoDoc*
:GoDoc [word]

    Open the relevant GoDoc in split window for either the word[s] passed to
    the command or by default, the word under the cursor.

                                                              *:GoDocBrowser*
:GoDocBrowser [word]

    Open the relevant GoDoc in browser for either the word[s] passed to the
    command or by default, the word under the cursor.

                                                                     *:GoFmt*
:GoFmt

    Filter the current Go buffer through gofmt.  It tries to preserve cursor
    position and avoids replacing the buffer with stderr output.

                                                                  *:GoImports*
:GoImports

    Filter the current Go buffer through goimports (needs to be installed).
    `goimports` automatically discards/add import path based on the code. Like
    |GoFmt|, It tries to preserve cursor position and avoids replacing the
    buffer with stderr output.

                                                                     *:GoPlay*
:[range]GoPlay

    Share snippet to play.golang.org. If no [range] is given it shares
    the whole file, otherwise the selected lines are shared. Snippet URL
    is copied to system clipboard if Vim is compiled with 'clipboard' or
     'xterm-clipboard' otherwise it's get yanked into the `""` register.

                                                                     *:GoVet*
:GoVet

    Run `go vet` for the directory under your current file. Vet examines Go
    source code and reports suspicious constructs, such as Printf calls whose
    arguments do not align with the format string. Vet uses heuristics that do not
    guarantee all reports are genuine problems, but it can find errors not caught
    by the compilers.

                                                                     *:GoDef*
:GoDef [identifier]

    Goto declaration/definition for the given [identifier]. If no argument is
    given, it will jump to the declaration under the cursor. By default the
    mapping `gd` is enabled to invoke GoDef for the identifier under the cursor.
    See |g:go_def_mapping_enabled| to disable it.

                                                                     *:GoRun*
:GoRun[!] [expand]

    Build and run your current main package. By default all main files for the
    current file is used. If an argument is passed, 'expand' is used as file
    selector. For example use `:GoRun %` to select the current file only.

    If [!] is not given the first error is jumped to.

                                                                   *:GoBuild*
:GoBuild[!] [options]

    Build your package with `go build`. It automatically builds only the files
    that depends on the current file. GoBuild doesn't produce a result file.
    Use 'make' to create a result file.

    You may optionally pass any valid go build flags/options. For a full list
    please see `go help build`.

    If [!] is not given the first error is jumped to.

                                                                    *:GoInfo*
:GoInfo
    Show type information about the identifer under the cursor. For example
    putting it above a function call is going to show the full function
    signature. It uses gocode to get the type informations.


                                                                 *:GoInstall*
:GoInstall

  Install your package with `go install`.

                                                                    *:GoTest*
:GoTest [expand]

    Test your _test.go files via in your current directory. Errors are
    populated in quickfix window.  If an argument is passed, 'expand' is used
    as file selector (useful for cases like `:GoTest ./...`).

                                                                *:GoCoverage*
:GoCoverage

    Create a coverage profile and open a browser to display the annotated
    source code of the current package.

                                                                *:GoErrCheck*
:GoErrCheck

    Check for unchecked errors in you current package. Errors are populated in
    quickfix window.

                                                                   *:GoFiles*

:GoUpdateBinaries

    Download and Update previously installed Go tool binaries such as `godef`,
    `goimports`, `gocode`, etc.. under `g:go_bin_path`. This can be used to
    update the necessary Go binaries.

                                                              *:GoImplements*
:GoImplements

    Show 'implements' relation for a selected package. A list of interfaces
    for the type that implements an interface under the cursor (or selected
    package) is shown in a custom window. Hit `<enter>` to jump in a new tab
    or close it via `<c-c>`.

                                                                *:GoRename*

TROUBLESHOOTING                                         *go-troubleshooting*

I'm using Fish shell but have some problems using Vim-go~

First environment variables in Fish are applied differently, it should be like:
>
	set -x GOPATH /your/own/gopath
<
Second, Vim needs a POSIX compatible shell (more info here:
https://github.com/dag/vim-fish#teach-a-vim-to-fish). If you use Fish to open
vim, it will make certainx shell based commands fail (means vim-go will fail
too). To overcome this problem change the default shell by adding the
following into your .vimrc (on the top of the file):
>
	if $SHELL =~ 'fish'
	  set shell='/bin/sh'
	endif
<
or
>
	set shell='/bin/sh'
>

I'm seeing weirds errors during the startup~

If you see errors like this:
>
  Error installing code.google.com/p/go.tools/cmd/goimports:
	Error installing code.google.com/p/rog-go/exp/cmd/godef:
<
that means your local Go setup is broken or the remote website is down.  For
example sometimes code.google.com times out. To test, just execute a simple go
get:

>
	go get code.google.com/p/go.tools/cmd/goimports
<
You'll see a more detailed error. If this works, vim-go will work too.
