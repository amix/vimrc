Installation
============

In general, your favorite method works.  Here are some options.

With pathogen.vim
-----------------

Install [pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen),
then copy and paste:

    git clone git://github.com/vim-ruby/vim-ruby.git ~/.vim/bundle/vim-ruby

With Vundle
-----------

Install [Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle), then add the
following to your vimrc:

    Bundle 'vim-ruby/vim-ruby'

With patience
-------------

Wait for an upgrade to Vim and install it.  Vim ships with the latest
version of vim-ruby at the time of its release.  (Remember this when
choosing another installation method.  The version you download will
supersede the version that ships with Vim, so you will now be
responsible for keeping it up-to-date.)

Manually
--------

[Download](https://github.com/vim-ruby/vim-ruby/archives/master) and
extract the relevant files to `~/.vim` (or `$HOME/vimfiles` on Windows).
