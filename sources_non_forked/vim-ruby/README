Summary:
  This project contains Vim configuration files for editing and compiling Ruby
  within Vim.  See the project homepage for more details.

Web links:
  Homepage: https://github.com/vim-ruby
  Explanation:  https://github.com/vim-ruby/vim-ruby/wiki

For regular users:
  - The project page should have two tarballs for download:
     - vim-ruby-YYYY.MM.DD.tar.gz  (the current stable release)
     - vim-ruby-devel-YYYY.MM.DD.tar.gz  (cutting-edge features we'd like you
       to test)
  - Please give feedback through the bug tracking and feature request features
    of github.
  - Feel free to join discussions on the vim-ruby-devel mailing list:
    http://rubyforge.org/mail/?group_id=16

For would-be contributors:
  - Please get the latest from Git.
  - Please join the mailing list and discuss changes, submit patches, etc.
  - Thank you very much for taking an interest.

Contents of the project:
  - The autoload, compiler, ftdetect, ftplugin, indent and syntax directories
    contain the ruby*.vim files that are to be copied to a location somewhere
    in the Vim 'runtimepath'.
  - vim-ruby-install.rb performs this copying.

How you get these files into Vim:
  - By downloading the project via a snapshot or Git, you can keep up with
    the latest, make changes, and install the files to a Vim directory.
  - By downloading one of the tarballs, you can easily install the latest
    stable or development version wherever you like on your machine.  No
    README, no vim-ruby-install.rb, just Vim files.  You would typically
    install these into either $VIM/vimfiles, for system-wide use, or $HOME/.vim
    ($HOME/vimfiles on Windows) for personal use.
  - Remember that when you install Vim in the first place, all of these files
    are present.  The purpose of downloading and installing them from
    github is to get the latest version of them.

Git topics:
  - Project was migrated from CVS in August, 2008.
  - Files are tagged according to which version of Vim they are released in.
  - The project was initiated in July 2003, when the current version of Vim
    was 6.2.  Thus every file began its life tagged as vim6.2.
  - Modifications to the files are made in the expectation that they need to
    be tested by interested users.  They therefore (probably) don't have a
    tag, and are available via "git pull --rebase", or a development snapshot.
  - When a modification is considered stable, it is given a tag.
    Everything that is stable gets released in vim-ruby-YYY.MM.DD.tar.gz files.
  - When a new version of Vim is about to be released, the stable tarball is
    contributed to it.  After it has been released, the files are tagged
    accordingly.
  - MORAL OF THE STORY: modifications are committed to the head of the tree;
    when they are ready for release into userland, they are tagged "stable".

Any questions or suggestions?
  - If there's something about the project or its concepts that you don't
    understand, send an email to the release coordinator, Doug Kearns
    (dougkearns at gmail.com).
  - To ask about the contents of the configuration files, open a GitHub issue
    or ask on the mailing list, as different people maintain the different
    files.

Project gossip:
  - While the individual effort to maintain these files has a long history,
    this actual project began in late July 2003.
