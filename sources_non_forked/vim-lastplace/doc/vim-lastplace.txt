INTRODUCTION                                    *vim-lastplace-introduction*

Intelligently reopen files where you left off.  By default git,
svn, and mercurial commit messages are ignored because you
probably want to type a new message and not re-edit the previous
one.

You can configure what file types to ignore by setting
g:lastplace_ignore in your vimrc. This is a comma separated list.
By default it is set to:

        let g:lastplace_ignore = "gitcommit,gitrebase,svn,hgcommit"

You can configure buffer types to ignore by setting
g:lastplace_ignore_buftype in your vimrc. This is a comma separated list.
By default it is set to:

        let g:lastplace_ignore_buftype = "quickfix,nofile,help"

Folds are automatically opened when jumping to the last edit position. If you
do not like this behavior you can disable it by putting this in your vimrc:

        let g:lastplace_open_folds = 0
