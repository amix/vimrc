ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ **Looking for a maintainer.** ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ This project needs your care and knowledge of VIM. Open an issue if you want to take that role.

# Warning
`ayu` is still in development and a lot of things need to be covered. Theme works only if VIM supports `termguicolors` option. This is true for [Neovim](https://neovim.io) and VIM from 7.4.1799.

# Installation
```VimL
Plug 'ayu-theme/ayu-vim' " or other package manager
"...
set termguicolors     " enable true colors support
let ayucolor="light"  " for light version of theme
let ayucolor="mirage" " for mirage version of theme
let ayucolor="dark"   " for dark version of theme
colorscheme ayu
```

# Term colors
For now In `/term` you can find color schemes for iTerm. More to come.

# Indent line
To get indent line like in the screenshot install https://github.com/Yggdroot/indentLine with my version of `Roboto Mono for Powerline` from this repo and add this config.
In this Roboto Mono version added powerline glyphs and increased line-height of the font itself.

```Viml
" IndentLine {{
let g:indentLine_char = 'î‚´'
let g:indentLine_first_char = 'î‚´'
let g:indentLine_showFirstIndentLevel = 1
let g:indentLine_setColors = 0
" }}
```
