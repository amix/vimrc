This library provides some utility functions. There isn't much need to 
install it unless another plugin requires you to do so.

The most useful functions provided by this library probably are:

tlib#input#List(), tlib#input#ListW()
    - Display a list
    - Dynamically filter items matching a pattern (somethat like google)
        - E.g. you filter for "foo -bar": show all entries containing foo but not bar.
    - Select items from a list
    - Do stuff
        - Developers can define keys that trigger some action with the 
          selected items
    - Demo: http://vimsomnia.blogspot.com/2010/11/selecting-items-from-list-with-tlibs.html

tlib#input#EditList
    + Edit a list (copy, cut, paste, delete, edit ...)

:TLet VAR = VALUE
    Set a variable only if it doesn't already exist.

:TScratch
    Open a scratch buffer (a buffer without a file).

:TVarArg VAR1, [VAR2, DEFAULT2] ...
    Handle "rest" (variable) arguments in functions.
    EXAMPLES:
      function! Foo(...)
          TVarArg ['a', 1], 'b'
          echo 'a='. a
          echo 'b='. b
      endf

TBrowseOutput COMMAND
    Every wondered how to effciently browse the output of a command 
    without redirecting it to a file? This command takes a command as 
    argument and presents the output via |tlib#input#List()| so that you 
    can easily search for a keyword (e.g. the name of a variable or 
    function) and the like.
    
    If you press enter, the selected line will be copied to the command 
    line. Press ESC to cancel browsing.
    
    EXAMPLES:
      TBrowseOutput 20verb TeaseTheCulprit
      TBrowseOutput let
      TBrowseOutput map
