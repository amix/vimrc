#### 5.0.0
- Refactor the code significantly:
    * Break the classes out into their own files.
    * Make the majority of the code OO - previously large parts were effectively a tangle of "global" methods.
- Add an API to assign flags to nodes. This allows VCS plugins like https://github.com/Xuyuanp/nerdtree-git-plugin to exist. Thanks to **Xuyuanp** for helping design/test/build said API.
- add `scope` argument to the key map API see :help NERDTreeAddKeyMap()
- add magic [[dir]] and [[file]] flags to NERDTreeIgnore
- add support for custom path filters. See :help NERDTreeAddPathFilter()

- make bookmarks work with `~` home shortcuts (hiberabyss)
- show OSX specific fsmenu options in regular vim on mac (evindor)
- make dir arrow icons configurable (PickRelated)
- optimise node sorting performance when opening large dirs (vtsang)
- make the root note render prettier by truncating it at a path slash (gcmt)
- remove NERDChristmasTree option - its always christmas now
- add "cascade" open and closing for dirs containing only another single dir. See :help NERDTreeCascadeOpenSingleChildDir (pendulm)
- Many other fixes, doc updates and contributions from: **actionshrimp**, **agrussellknives**, **alvan**, **AndrewRadev**, **cperl82** (*many small fixes*), **devmanhinton**, **egalpin**, **franksort**, **gastropoda**, **handcraftedbits**, **kelaban**, **lucascaton**, **mixvin**, **pendulm**, **SchDen**, **shanesmith**, **staeff**, **stephenprater**, **toiffel**, **Twinside**, **WoLpH**, **xiaodili**, **zhangoose**

- add some mac specific options to the filesystem menu - for macvim only (andersonfreitas)

#### 4.1.0
- features:
    - NERDTreeFind to reveal the node for the current buffer in the tree, see `|NERDTreeFind|`. This effectively merges the FindInNERDTree plugin (by **Doug McInnes**) into the script.
    - make NERDTreeQuitOnOpen apply to the t/T keymaps too. Thanks to **Stefan Ritter** and **R√©mi Pr√©vost**.
    - truncate the root node if wider than the tree window. Thanks to **Victor Gonzalez**.

- bugfixes:
    - really fix window state restoring
    - fix some win32 path escaping issues. Thanks to **Stephan Baumeister**, **Ricky**, **jfilip1024**, and **Chris Chambers**.

#### 4.0.0
- add a new programmable menu system (see `:help NERDTreeMenu`).
- add new APIs to add menus/menu-items to the menu system as well as custom key mappings to the NERD tree buffer (see `:help NERDTreeAPI`).
- removed the old API functions
- added a mapping to maximize/restore the size of nerd tree window, thanks to Guillaume Duranceau for the patch. See :help NERDTree-A for details.
- fix a bug where secondary nerd trees (netrw hijacked trees) and NERDTreeQuitOnOpen didnt play nicely, thanks to **Curtis Harvey**.
- fix a bug where the script ignored directories whose name ended in a dot, thanks to **Aggelos Orfanakos** for the patch.
- fix a bug when using the x mapping on the tree root, thanks to **Bryan Venteicher** for the patch.
- fix a bug where the cursor position/window size of the nerd tree buffer wasnt being stored on closing the window, thanks to **Richard Hart**.
- fix a bug where NERDTreeMirror would mirror the wrong tree

#### 3.1.1
- fix a bug where a non-listed no-name buffer was getting created every time the tree windows was created, thanks to **Derek Wyatt** and **owen1**
- make `<CR>` behave the same as the `o` mapping
- some helptag fixes in the doc, thanks **strull**.
- fix a bug when using `:set nohidden` and opening a file where the previous buf was modified. Thanks **iElectric**.
- other minor fixes

#### 3.1.0
- New features:
    - add mappings to open files in a vsplit, see `:help NERDTree-s` and `:help NERDTree-gs`
    - make the statusline for the nerd tree window default to something hopefully more useful. See `:help 'NERDTreeStatusline'`
- Bugfixes:
    - make the hijack netrw functionality work when vim is started with `vim <some dir>` (thanks to **Alf Mikula** for the patch).
    - fix a bug where the CWD wasnt being changed for some operations even when NERDTreeChDirMode==2 (thanks to **Lucas S. Buchala**)
    - add -bar to all the nerd tree :commands so they can chain with other :commands (thanks to **tpope**)
    - fix bugs when ignorecase was set (thanks to **nach**)
    - fix a bug with the relative path code (thanks to **nach**)
    - fix a bug where doing a `:cd` would cause `:NERDTreeToggle` to fail (thanks **nach**)


#### 3.0.1
- Bugfixes:
    - fix bugs with :NERDTreeToggle and :NERDTreeMirror when `'hidden'` was not set
    - fix a bug where `:NERDTree <path>` would fail if `<path>` was relative and didnt start with a `./` or `../`  Thanks to **James Kanze**.
    - make the `q` mapping work with secondary (`:e <dir>`  style) trees, thanks to **jamessan**
    - fix a bunch of small bugs with secondary trees
- More insane refactoring.

#### 3.0.0
- hijack netrw so that doing an `:edit <directory>`  will put a NERD tree in the window rather than a netrw browser. See :help 'NERDTreeHijackNetrw'
- allow sharing of trees across tabs, see `:help :NERDTreeMirror`
- remove "top" and "bottom" as valid settings for NERDTreeWinPos
- change the `'<tab>'` mapping to `'i'`
