5.0.0
    - Refactor the code significantly:
        * Break the classes out into their own files.
        * Make the majority of the code OO - previously large parts were
          effectively a tangle of "global" methods.
    - Add an API to assign flags to nodes. This allows VCS plugins like
      https://github.com/Xuyuanp/nerdtree-git-plugin to exist. Thanks to
      Xuyuanp for helping design/test/build said API.
    - add 'scope' argument to the key map API see :help NERDTreeAddKeyMap()
    - add magic [[dir]] and [[file]] flags to NERDTreeIgnore
    - add support for custom path filters. See :help NERDTreeAddPathFilter()
    - add path listener API. See :help NERDTreePathListenerAPI.
    - expand the fs menu functionality to list file properties (PhilRunninger,
      apbarrero, JESii)
    - make bookmarks work with `~` home shortcuts (hiberabyss)
    - show OSX specific fsmenu options in regular vim on mac (evindor)
    - make dir arrow icons configurable (PickRelated)
    - optimise node sorting performance when opening large dirs (vtsang)
    - make the root note render prettier by truncating it at a path slash (gcmt)
    - remove NERDChristmasTree option - its always christmas now
    - add "cascade" open and closing for dirs containing only another single
      dir. See :help NERDTreeCascadeOpenSingleChildDir (pendulm)

4.1.0
    features:
    - NERDTreeFind to reveal the node for the current buffer in the tree,
      see |NERDTreeFind|. This effectively merges the FindInNERDTree plugin (by
      Doug McInnes) into the script.
    - make NERDTreeQuitOnOpen apply to the t/T keymaps too. Thanks to Stefan
      Ritter and Rémi Prévost.
    - truncate the root node if wider than the tree window. Thanks to Victor
      Gonzalez.

    bugfixes:
    - really fix window state restoring
    - fix some win32 path escaping issues. Thanks to Stephan Baumeister, Ricky,
      jfilip1024, and Chris Chambers

4.0.0
    - add a new programmable menu system (see :help NERDTreeMenu).

      custom key mappings to the NERD tree buffer (see :help NERDTreeAPI).
    - removed the old API functions
    - added a mapping to maximize/restore the size of nerd tree window, thanks
      to Guillaume Duranceau for the patch. See :help NERDTree-A for details.

    - fix a bug where secondary nerd trees (netrw hijacked trees) and
      NERDTreeQuitOnOpen didnt play nicely, thanks to Curtis Harvey.
    - fix a bug where the script ignored directories whose name ended in a dot,
      thanks to Aggelos Orfanakos for the patch.
    - fix a bug when using the x mapping on the tree root, thanks to Bryan
      Venteicher for the patch.
    - fix a bug where the cursor position/window size of the nerd tree buffer
      wasnt being stored on closing the window, thanks to Richard Hart.
    - fix a bug where NERDTreeMirror would mirror the wrong tree

3.1.1

      time the tree windows was created, thanks to Derek Wyatt and owen1
    - make <CR> behave the same as the 'o' mapping
    - some helptag fixes in the doc, thanks strull

      buf was modified. Thanks iElectric
    - other minor fixes

    - add mappings to open files in a vsplit, see :help NERDTree-s and :help
      NERDTree-gs

      hopefully more useful. See :help 'NERDTreeStatusline'

    - make the hijack netrw functionality work when vim is started with "vim
      <some dir>" (thanks to Alf Mikula for the patch).

      :commands (thanks to tpope)

      was not set
    - fix a bug where :NERDTree <path> would fail if <path> was relative and

      thanks to jamessan

    More insane refactoring.
