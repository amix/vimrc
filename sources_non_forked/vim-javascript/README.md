# vim-javascript v0.9.0

JavaScript bundle for vim, this bundle provides syntax and indent plugins.

## A Quick Note on Regexes

Vim 7.4 was released recently, and unfortunately broke how this plugin
handles regexes. There was no real easy way for us to fix this unless we
completely rewrote how regexes work.

Good News: There was a recent update to Vim 7.4 that fixes this issue.

Make sure you are at least using Vim 7.4, with patches 1-7.

If you are stuck on an older version of Vim 7.4 with no way to update,
then simply perform the following commands to fix your current buffer:

```
:set regexpengine=1
:syntax enable
```
