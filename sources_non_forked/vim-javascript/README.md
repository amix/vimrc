## Configuration Variables

The following variables control certain syntax highlighting plugins. You can
add them to your `.vimrc` to enable their features.

-----------------

```
let g:javascript_plugin_jsdoc = 1
```

Enables syntax highlighting for [JSDocs](http://usejsdoc.org/).

Default Value: 0

-----------------

```
let g:javascript_plugin_ngdoc = 1
```

Enables some additional syntax highlighting for NGDocs. Requires JSDoc plugin
to be enabled as well.

Default Value: 0

-----------------

```
let g:javascript_plugin_flow = 1
```

Enables syntax highlighting for [Flow](https://flowtype.org/).

Default Value: 0

-----------------

```
set foldmethod=syntax
```

Please note this can have a dramatic effect on performance and because it is a
global vim option, we do not set it ourselves.

You can customize concealing characters by defining one or more of the following
variables:

    let g:javascript_conceal_function       = "ƒ"
    let g:javascript_conceal_null           = "ø"
    let g:javascript_conceal_this           = "@"
