# vim-pug #

Vim syntax highlighting for Pug (formerly Jade) templates.

Installation
------------

I prefer to install plugins using Tim Pope's 
[pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen).  Installation using
pathogen is quite simple.

    cd ~/.vim/bundle
    git clone git://github.com/digitaltoad/vim-pug.git

If you do not want to use pathogen.  You can always install vim-pug in the 
normal manner by copying each directory to your ~/.vim directory.  Make sure 
not to overwrite any existing directory of the same name and instead copy only 
the contents of the source directory to the directory of the same name in your 
~/.vim directory.
