This directory contains the main scripts that come bundled with UltiSnips.

Standing On The Shoulders of Giants
===================================

The snippets have been collected from various other project which I want to
express my gratitude for. My main source for inspiration where the following
two projects:

   TextMate: http://svn.textmate.org/trunk/Bundles/
   SnipMate: http://code.google.com/p/snipmate/

All snippets from those sources were copied and cleaned up, so that they are 
  - not using shell script, only python (so they are cross platform compatible)
  - not using any feature that UltiSnips doesn't offer

UltiSnips has seen contributions by various individuals. Those contributions
have been merged into this collection seamlessly and without further comments.
