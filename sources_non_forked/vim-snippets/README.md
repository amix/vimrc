Snipmate & UltiSnip Snippets
============================

This repository contains snippets files for various programming languages.

It is community-maintained and many people have contributed snippet files and
other improvements already.

Contents

    snippets/*: snippets using snipmate format
    UltiSnips/*: snippets using UltiSnips format

Snippet engines
===============

There are different forks of snippet engines which allow the user to insert
sippets by typing the name of a snippet hitting the expansion mapping.

    garbas/vim-snipmate [4]:
      VimL, snipmate-snippets, engine sometimes behaves strange, supports
      rewriting snippets on the fly (eg adding a second version with folding
      markers)

    MarcWeber/UltiSnips [6]:
      python, snipmate-snippets and UltiSnips-snippets

    SirVer/ultisnips [7]:
      python, UltiSnips-snippets

    github.com/Shougo/neosnippet [5]:
      viml, has a compatible mode allowing to reuse most snipmate snippets ?

    XPTemplate:
      totally different syntax, does not read snippets contained in this file,
      but it is also very powerful

    ... there are some more, but they have less features which is why I don't
    mention them here

UltiSnips engine has additional features such as "nested snippets".

Which one to use? If you have python give MarcWeber/UltiSnips a try because its
fast and supports all important features. You can prefer the UltiSnip versions
of the snippets by setting the "always_use_first_snippet" option to 1.

If you have VimL only (vim without python support) your best option is using
garbas/vim-snipmate and cope with the minor bugs found in the engine.

Related repositories
====================
We also encourage people to maintain sets of snippets for particular use cases
so that all users can benefit from them.  People can list their snippet repositories here:

     * https://github.com/rbonvall/snipmate-snippets-bib (snippets for BibTeX files)
     * https://github.com/sudar/vim-arduino-snippets (snippets for Arduino files)
     * https://github.com/zedr/zope-snipmate-bundle.git (snippets for Python, TAL and ZCML)
     * https://github.com/bonsaiben/bootstrap-snippets (snippets for Twitter Bootstrap markup, in HTML and Haml)

Historical notes
================

[vim-snipmate][1] was originally started by [Michael Sanders][2] who has now
unfortunately abandoned the project. [Rok Garbas][3] is now maintaining a
[fork][4] of the project in hopes of improving the existing code base.

Versions / dialects / ..
========================
There are some issues, such as newer language versions may require other
snippets than older. If this exists we currently recommend doing this:

add snippets/ruby.snippets (common snippets)
add snippets/ruby-1.8.snippets (1.8 only)
add snippets/ruby-1.9.snippets (1.9 only)

then configure github.com/garbas/vim-snipmate this way:

    let g:snipMate = {}
    let g:snipMate.scope_aliases = {}
    let g:snipMate.scope_aliases['ruby'] = 'ruby,ruby-rails,ruby-1.9'

or github.com/MarcWeber/UltiSnips this way:


    let g:UltiSnips = {}

    let g:UltiSnips.snipmate_ft_filter = {
                \ 'default' : {'filetypes': ["FILETYPE"] },
                \ 'ruby'    : {'filetypes': ["ruby", "ruby-rails", "ruby-1.9"] },


If it happens that you work on a project requiring ruby-1.8 snippets instead,
consider using vim-addon-local-vimrc and override the filetypes.

Well - of course it may not make sense to create a new file for each
ruby-library-version triplet. Sometimes postfixing a name such as

    migrate_lib_20_down
    migrate_lib_20_up

will do it then if syntax has changed.

Language maintainers
--------------------

No one can really be proficient in all programming languages. If you would like
to maintain snippets for a language, please get in touch.

Notes: People are interested in snippets - and their interest may stop again
at will. So its ok if people maintain a language only for a short period of
time - or jump in and get things done - don't let the flow stop :)
vim-snippets is not like the "linux kernel".

Contributing notes
------------------

Until further work is done on `vim-snipmate`, please don't add folding markers
into snippets. `vim-snipmate` has some comments about how to patch all snippets
on the fly adding those.

Because MarcWeber/UltiSnips [6] supports also snipmate-snippets there is no
need to duplicate all snippets - only those snippets who use advanced UltiSnips
features should be duplicated in UltiSnips (?)

Currently all snippets from UltiSnips have been put into UltiSnips - some work
on merging should be done (dropping duplicates etc)
