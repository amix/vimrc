INTRODUCTION                                    *fugitive*

Whenever you edit a file from a Git repository, a set of commands is defined
that serve as a gateway to Git.

COMMANDS                                        *fugitive-commands*

These commands are local to the buffers in which they work (generally, buffers
that are part of Git repositories).

                                                *fugitive-:Git*
:Git [args]             Run an arbitrary git command. Similar to :!git [args]
                        but chdir to the repository tree first.

                                                *fugitive-:Git!*
:Git! [args]            Like |:Git|, but capture the output into a temp file,
                        and edit that temp file.

                                                *fugitive-:Gcd*
:Gcd [directory]        |:cd| relative to the repository.

                                                *fugitive-:Glcd*
:Glcd [directory]       |:lcd| relative to the repository.

                                                *fugitive-:Gstatus*
:Gstatus                Bring up the output of git-status in the preview
                        window.  The following maps, which work on the cursor
                        line file where sensible, are provided:

                        g?    show this help
                        <C-N> next file
                        <C-P> previous file
                        <CR>  |:Gedit|
                        -     |:Git| add
                        -     |:Git| reset (staged files)
                        a     Show alternative format
                        ca    |:Gcommit| --amend
                        cc    |:Gcommit|
                        ce    |:Gcommit| --amend --no-edit
                        cw    |:Gcommit| --amend --only
                        cva   |:Gcommit| --verbose --amend
                        cvc   |:Gcommit| --verbose
                        D     |:Gdiff|
                        ds    |:Gsdiff|
                        dp    |:Git!| diff (p for patch; use :Gw to apply)
                        dp    |:Git| add --intent-to-add (untracked files)
                        dv    |:Gvdiff|
                        O     |:Gtabedit|
                        o     |:Gsplit|
                        P     |:Git| add --patch
                        P     |:Git| reset --patch (staged files)
                        q     close status
                        r     reload status
                        S     |:Gvsplit|
                        U     |:Git| checkout
                        U     |:Git| checkout HEAD (staged files)
                        U     |:Git| clean (untracked files)
                        U     |:Git| rm (unmerged files)
                        .     enter |:| command line with file prepopulated

                                                *fugitive-:Gcommit*
:Gcommit [args]         A wrapper around git-commit.  If there is nothing
                        to commit, |:Gstatus| is called instead.  Unless the
                        arguments given would skip the invocation of an editor
                        (e.g., -m), a split window will be used to obtain a
                        commit message, or a new tab if -v is given.  Write
                        and close that window (:wq or |:Gwrite|) to finish the
                        commit.  Unlike when running the actual git-commit
                        command, it is possible (but unadvisable) to alter the
                        index with commands like git-add and git-reset while a
                        commit message is pending.

                                                *fugitive-:Gmerge*
:Gmerge [args]          Calls git-merge and loads errors and conflicted files
                        into the |quickfix| list.  Opens a |:Gcommit| style
                        split window for the commit message if the merge
                        succeeds.  If called during a merge conflict, the
                        conflicted files from the current index are loaded
                        into the |quickfix| list.

                                                *fugitive-:Gpull*
:Gpull [args]           Like |:Gmerge|, but for git-pull.

                                                *fugitive-:Grebase*
:Grebase [args]         Like |:Gmerge|, but for git-rebase.  Interactive
                        rebase not supported.

                                                *fugitive-:Gpush*
:Gpush [args]           Invoke git-push, load the results into the |quickfix|
                        list, and invoke |:cwindow| to reveal any errors.
                        |:Dispatch| is used if available for asynchronous
                        invocation.

                                                *fugitive-:Gfetch*
:Gfetch [args]          Like |:Gpush|, but for git-fetch.

                                                *fugitive-:Ggrep*
:Ggrep[!] [args]        |:grep|[!] with git-grep as 'grepprg'.

                                                *fugitive-:Glgrep*
:Glgrep[!] [args]       |:lgrep|[!] with git-grep as 'grepprg'.

                                                *fugitive-:Glog*
:Glog [args]            Load all previous revisions of the current file into
                        the |quickfix| list.  Additional git-log arguments can
                        be given (for example, --reverse).  If "--" appears as
                        an argument, no file specific filtering is done, and
                        previous commits rather than previous file revisions
                        are loaded.

:{range}Glog [args]     Use git-log -L to load previous revisions of the given
                        range of the current file into the |quickfix| list.
                        The cursor is positioned on the first line of the
                        first diff hunk for each commit.

                                                *fugitive-:Gllog*
:Gllog [args]           Like |:Glog|, but use the location list instead of the
                        |quickfix| list.

                                        *fugitive-:Gedit* *fugitive-:Ge*
:Gedit [object]         |:edit| a |fugitive-object|.

                                                *fugitive-:Gsplit*
:Gsplit [object]        |:split| a |fugitive-object|.

                                                *fugitive-:Gvsplit*
:Gvsplit [object]       |:vsplit| a |fugitive-object|.

                                                *fugitive-:Gtabedit*
:Gtabedit [object]      |:tabedit| a |fugitive-object|.

                                                *fugitive-:Gpedit*
:Gpedit [object]        |:pedit| a |fugitive-object|.

:Gsplit! [args]                 *fugitive-:Gsplit!* *fugitive-:Gvsplit!*
:Gvsplit! [args]                *fugitive-:Gtabedit!* *fugitive-:Gpedit!*
:Gtabedit! [args]       Like |:Git!|, but open the resulting temp file in a
:Gpedit! [args]         split, tab, or preview window.

                                                *fugitive-:Gread*
:Gread [object]         Empty the buffer and |:read| a |fugitive-object|.
                        When the argument is omitted, this is similar to
                        git-checkout on a work tree file or git-add on a stage
                        file, but without writing anything to disk.

:{range}Gread [object]  |:read| in a |fugitive-object| after {range}.

                                                *fugitive-:Gread!*
:Gread! [args]          Empty the buffer and |:read| the output of a Git
                        command.  For example, :Gread! show HEAD:%.

:{range}Gread! [args]  |:read| the output of a Git command after {range}.

                                        *fugitive-:Gw* *fugitive-:Gwrite*
:Gwrite                 Write to the current file's path and stage the results.
                        When run in a work tree file, it is effectively git
                        add.  Elsewhere, it is effectively git-checkout.  A
                        great deal of effort is expended to behave sensibly
                        when the work tree or index version of the file is
                        open in another buffer.

:Gwrite {path}          You can give |:Gwrite| an explicit path of where in
                        the work tree to write.  You can also give a path like
                        :0:foo.txt or even :0 to write to just that stage in
                        the index.

                                                *fugitive-:Gwq*
:Gwq [path]             Like |:Gwrite| followed by |:quit| if the write
                        succeeded.

:Gwq! [path]            Like |:Gwrite|! followed by |:quit|! if the write
                        succeeded.

                                                *fugitive-:Gdiff*
:Gdiff [object]         Perform a |vimdiff| against the given file, or if a
                        commit is given, the current file in that commit.
                        With no argument, the version in the index is used
                        (which means a three-way diff during a merge conflict,
                        making it a git-mergetool alternative).  The newer of
                        the two files is placed to the right or bottom,
                        depending on 'diffopt', and the width of the window
                        relative to 'textwidth'.  Use |do| and |dp| and write
                        to the index file to simulate "git add --patch". For
                        the three-way diff, there is also d2o and d3o pulling
                        the hunk to the middle from the left or the right
                        window, respectively.

                                                *fugitive-:Gsdiff*
:Gsdiff [object]        Like |:Gdiff|, but always split horizontally.

                                                *fugitive-:Gvdiff*
:Gvdiff [object]        Like |:Gdiff|, but always split vertically.

                                                *fugitive-:Gmove*
:Gmove {destination}    Wrapper around git-mv that renames the buffer
                        afterward.  Add a ! to pass -f.

                                                *fugitive-:Grename*
:Grename {destination}  Like |:Gmove| but operates relative to the parent
                        directory of the current file.

                                                *fugitive-:Gdelete*
:Gdelete                Wrapper around git-rm that deletes the buffer
                        afterward.  When invoked in an index file, --cached is
                        passed.  Add a ! to pass -f and forcefully discard the
                        buffer.

                                                *fugitive-:Gremove*
:Gremove                Like :Gdelete, but keep the (now empty) buffer around.

                                                *fugitive-:Gblame*
:Gblame [flags]         Run git-blame on the file and open the results in a
                        scroll bound vertical split.  You can give any of
                        ltfnsewMC as flags and they will be passed along to
                        git-blame.  The following maps, which work on the
                        cursor line commit where sensible, are provided:

                        g?    show this help
                        A     resize to end of author column
                        C     resize to end of commit column
                        D     resize to end of date/time column
                        q     close blame and return to blamed window
                        gq    q, then |:Gedit| to return to work tree version
                        <CR>  q, then open commit
                        o     open commit in horizontal split
                        O     open commit in new tab
                        p     open commit in preview window
                        -     reblame at commit
                        ~     reblame at [count]th first grandparent
                        P     reblame at [count]th parent (like HEAD^[count])

                                                *fugitive-:Gbrowse*
:Gbrowse                Open the current file, blob, tree, commit, or tag
                        in your browser at the upstream hosting provider.
                        If a range is given, it is appropriately appended to
                        the URL as an anchor.

                        Upstream providers can be added by installing an
                        appropriate Vim plugin.  For example, GitHub can be
                        supported by installing rhubarb.vim, available at
                        <https://github.com/tpope/vim-rhubarb>.

:Gbrowse {object}       Like :Gbrowse, but for a given |fugitive-object|.

:Gbrowse [...]@{remote} Force using the given remote rather than the remote
                        for the current branch.  The remote is used to
                        determine which upstream repository to link to.

:{range}Gbrowse [args]  Appends an anchor to the URL that emphasizes the
                        selected lines. This also forces the URL to include a
                        commit rather than a branch name so it remains valid
                        if the file changes.  You can give a range of "0" to
                        force this behavior without including an anchor.

:[range]Gbrowse! [args] Like :Gbrowse, but put the URL on the clipboard rather
                        than opening it.

MAPPINGS                                        *fugitive-mappings*

These maps are available everywhere.

                                                *fugitive-c_CTRL-R_CTRL-G*
<C-R><C-G>              On the command line, recall the path to the current
                        |fugitive-object| (that is, a representation of the
                        object recognized by |:Gedit|).

                                                *fugitive-y_CTRL-G*
["x]y<C-G>              Yank the commit SHA and path to the current
                        |fugitive-object|.

SPECIFYING OBJECTS                      *fugitive-object* *fugitive-revision*

Fugitive objects are either work tree files or Git revisions as defined in the
"SPECIFYING REVISIONS" section in the git-rev-parse man page, with expansions
inspired by |cmdline-special| layered on top.  For commands that accept an
optional object, the default is the file in the index for work tree files and
the work tree file for everything else.  Example objects follow.

Object          Meaning ~
HEAD            .git/HEAD
refs/heads/x    .git/refs/heads/x (in "common dir" if present)
@               The commit referenced by @ aka HEAD
master^         The parent of the commit referenced by master
master:         The tree referenced by master
./master        The file named master in the working directory
Makefile        The file named Makefile in the work tree
@^:Makefile     The file named Makefile in the parent of HEAD
:Makefile       The file named Makefile in the index (writable)
@~2:%           The current file in the grandparent of HEAD
:%              The current file in the index
:1:%            The current file's common ancestor during a conflict
:2:#            The alternate file in the target branch during a conflict
:3:#5           The file from buffer #5 in the merged branch during a conflict
!               The commit owning the current file
!:Makefile      The file named Makefile in the commit owning the current file
!3^2            The second parent of the commit owning buffer #3
.git/config     The repo config file
:               Same as |:Gstatus|

STATUSLINE                                      *fugitive-statusline*

                                *FugitiveStatusline()* *fugitive#statusline()*
Add %{FugitiveStatusline()} to your statusline to get an indicator including
the current branch and the currently edited file's commit.  If you don't have
a statusline, this one matches the default when 'ruler' is set:
>
    set statusline=%<%f\ %h%m%r%{FugitiveStatusline()}%=%-14.(%l,%c%V%)\ %P
<
                                *FugitiveHead(...)* *fugitive#head(...)*
Use FugitiveHead() to return the name of the current branch. If the current
HEAD is detached, FugitiveHead() will return the empty string, unless the
optional argument is given, in which case the hash of the current commit will
be truncated to the given number of characters.
