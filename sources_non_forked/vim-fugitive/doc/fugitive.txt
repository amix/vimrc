INTRODUCTION                                    *fugitive*

Whenever you edit a file from a Git repository, a set of commands is defined
that serve as a gateway to Git.

COMMANDS                                        *fugitive-commands*

These commands are local to the buffers in which they work (generally, buffers
that are part of Git repositories).

                                        *fugitive-:G* *fugitive-:Gstatus*
:G                      Bring up a summary window vaguely akin to git-status.
:Gstatus                Press g? or see |fugitive-mappings| for usage.

                                                *fugitive-:Git*
:Git {args}             Run an arbitrary git command. Similar to :!git [args]
:G {args}               but chdir to the repository tree first.  For some
                        subcommands, a Fugitive command is called instead.
                        Invoking :Git push will call :Gpush for example.

                                                *fugitive-:Git!*
:Git! {args}            Like |:Git|, but capture the output into a temp file,
:Git --no-pager {args}  and |:split| that temp file.  Use :0Git to
:Git -P {args}          |:edit| the temp file instead.  A temp file is always
                        used for diff and log commands.

                                                *fugitive-:Gcd*
:Gcd [directory]        |:cd| relative to the repository.

                                                *fugitive-:Glcd*
:Glcd [directory]       |:lcd| relative to the repository.

                                                *fugitive-:Gcommit*
:Gcommit [args]         A wrapper around git-commit.  Unless the arguments
                        given would skip the invocation of an editor (e.g.,
                        -m), a split window will be used to obtain a commit
                        message, or a new tab if -v is given.  Write and close
                        the window (:wq) to finish the commit. To cancel, use
                        an empty message.

                                                *fugitive-:Grevert*
:Grevert [args]         A wrapper around git-revert.  Similar to |:Gcommit|.

                                                *fugitive-:Gmerge*
:Gmerge [args]          Calls git-merge and loads errors and conflicted files
                        into the |quickfix| list.  Opens a |:Gcommit| style
                        split window for the commit message if the merge
                        succeeds.  If called during a merge conflict, the
                        conflicted files from the current index are loaded
                        into the |quickfix| list.

                                                *fugitive-:Gpull*
:Gpull [args]           Like |:Gmerge|, but for git-pull.

                                                *fugitive-:Grebase*
:Grebase [args]         Like |:Gmerge|, but for git-rebase.  Interactive
                        rebase is experimentally supported.

                                                *fugitive-:Gpush*
:Gpush [args]           Invoke git-push, load the results into the |quickfix|
                        list, and invoke |:cwindow| to reveal any errors.
                        |:Dispatch| is used if available for asynchronous
                        invocation.

                                                *fugitive-:Gfetch*
:Gfetch [args]          Like |:Gpush|, but for git-fetch.

                                        *fugitive-:Ggrep* *fugitive-:Gcgrep*
:Ggrep[!] [args]        |:grep|[!] with git-grep as 'grepprg'.

                                                *fugitive-:Glgrep*
:Glgrep[!] [args]       |:lgrep|[!] with git-grep as 'grepprg'.

                                        *fugitive-:Gclog* *fugitive-:Glog*
:Gclog[!] [args]        Use git-log [args] to load the commit history into the
:Glog[!] [args]         |quickfix| list.  Jump to the first commit unless [!]
                        is given.

:{range}Gclog[!] [args] Use git-log -L to load previous revisions of the given
                        range of the current file into the |quickfix| list.
                        The cursor is positioned on the first line of the
                        first diff hunk for each commit.  Use :0Gclog to
                        target the entire file.

                                                *fugitive-:Gllog*
:Gllog [args]           Like |:Gclog|, but use the location list instead of the
                        |quickfix| list.

                                        *fugitive-:Gedit* *fugitive-:Ge*
:Gedit [object]         |:edit| a |fugitive-object|.

                                                *fugitive-:Gsplit*
:Gsplit [object]        |:split| a |fugitive-object|.

                                                *fugitive-:Gvsplit*
:Gvsplit [object]       |:vsplit| a |fugitive-object|.

                                                *fugitive-:Gtabedit*
:Gtabedit [object]      |:tabedit| a |fugitive-object|.

                                                *fugitive-:Gpedit*
:Gpedit [object]        |:pedit| a |fugitive-object|.

:Gsplit! [args]                 *fugitive-:Gsplit!* *fugitive-:Gvsplit!*
:Gvsplit! [args]                *fugitive-:Gtabedit!* *fugitive-:Gpedit!*
:Gtabedit! [args]       Capture the output of `git [args]` to a temp file and
:Gpedit! [args]         open it in a split, tab, or preview window.  Use
                        :0Gsplit! to suppress the split and open it in the
                        current window.

                                                *fugitive-:Gread*
:Gread [object]         Empty the buffer and |:read| a |fugitive-object|.
                        When the argument is omitted, this is similar to
                        git-checkout on a work tree file or git-add on a stage
                        file, but without writing anything to disk.

:{range}Gread [object]  |:read| in a |fugitive-object| after {range}.

                                                *fugitive-:Gread!*
:Gread! [args]          Empty the buffer and |:read| the output of a Git
                        command.  For example, :Gread! show HEAD:%.

:{range}Gread! [args]  |:read| the output of a Git command after {range}.

                                        *fugitive-:Gw* *fugitive-:Gwrite*
:Gwrite                 Write to the current file's path and stage the results.
                        When run in a work tree file, it is effectively git
                        add.  Elsewhere, it is effectively git-checkout.  A
                        great deal of effort is expended to behave sensibly
                        when the work tree or index version of the file is
                        open in another buffer.

:Gwrite {path}          You can give |:Gwrite| an explicit path of where in
                        the work tree to write.  You can also give a path like
                        :0:foo.txt or :0:% to write to just that stage in
                        the index.

                                                *fugitive-:Gwq*
:Gwq [path]             Like |:Gwrite| followed by |:quit| if the write
                        succeeded.

:Gwq! [path]            Like |:Gwrite|! followed by |:quit|! if the write
                        succeeded.

                                                *fugitive-:Gdiffsplit*
:Gdiffsplit [object]    Perform a |vimdiff| against the given file, or if a
                        commit is given, the current file in that commit.
                        With no argument, the version in the index or work
                        tree is used.  The newer of the two files is placed to
                        the right or bottom, depending on 'diffopt' and the
                        width of the window relative to 'textwidth'.  Use
                        Vim's |do| and |dp| to stage and unstage changes.

                                                *fugitive-:Gdiffsplit!*
:Gdiffsplit!            Diff against any and all direct ancestors, retaining
                        focus on the current window.  During a merge conflict,
                        this is a three-way diff against the "ours" and
                        "theirs" ancestors.  Additional d2o and d3o maps are
                        provided to to obtain the hunk from the "ours" or
                        "theirs" ancestor, respectively.

:Gdiffsplit! {object}   Like |:Gdiffsplit|, but retain focus on the current
                        window.

                                                *fugitive-:Gvdiffsplit*
:Gvdiffsplit [object]   Like |:Gdiffsplit|, but always split vertically.

                                *fugitive-:Ghdiffsplit* *fugitive-:Gsdiff*
:Ghdiffsplit [object]   Like |:Gdiffsplit|, but always split horizontally.

                                                *fugitive-:Gmove*
:Gmove {destination}    Wrapper around git-mv that renames the buffer
                        afterward.  Add a ! to pass -f.

                                                *fugitive-:Grename*
:Grename {destination}  Like |:Gmove| but operates relative to the parent
                        directory of the current file.

                                                *fugitive-:Gdelete*
:Gdelete                Wrapper around git-rm that deletes the buffer
                        afterward.  When invoked in an index file, --cached is
                        passed.  Add a ! to pass -f and forcefully discard the
                        buffer.

                                                *fugitive-:Gremove*
:Gremove                Like :Gdelete, but keep the (now empty) buffer around.

                                                *fugitive-:Gblame*
:Gblame [flags]         Run git-blame [flags] on the current file and open the
                        results in a scroll-bound vertical split.  The
                        following maps, which work on the cursor line commit
                        where sensible, are provided:

                        g?    show this help
                        A     resize to end of author column
                        C     resize to end of commit column
                        D     resize to end of date/time column
                        gq    close blame, then |:Gedit| to return to work
                              tree version
                        <CR>  close blame, and jump to patch that added line
                              (or directly to blob for boundary commit)
                        o     jump to patch or blob in horizontal split
                        O     jump to patch or blob in new tab
                        p     jump to patch or blob in preview window
                        -     reblame at commit
                        ~     reblame at [count]th first grandparent
                        P     reblame at [count]th parent (like HEAD^[count])

:[range]Gblame [flags]  If a range is given, just that part of the file will
:Gblame [flags] {file}  be blamed, and a horizontal split without
                        scrollbinding is used.  You can also give an arbitrary
                        filename.

                                                *fugitive-:Gbrowse*
:Gbrowse                Open the current file, blob, tree, commit, or tag
                        in your browser at the upstream hosting provider.
                        If a range is given, it is appropriately appended to
                        the URL as an anchor.

                        Upstream providers can be added by installing an
                        appropriate Vim plugin.  For example, GitHub can be
                        supported by installing rhubarb.vim, available at
                        <https://github.com/tpope/vim-rhubarb>.

:Gbrowse {object}       Like :Gbrowse, but for a given |fugitive-object|.

:Gbrowse [...]@{remote} Force using the given remote rather than the remote
                        for the current branch.  The remote is used to
                        determine which upstream repository to link to.

:{range}Gbrowse [args]  Appends an anchor to the URL that emphasizes the
                        selected lines. This also forces the URL to include a
                        commit rather than a branch name so it remains valid
                        if the file changes.  You can give a range of "0" to
                        force this behavior without including an anchor.

:[range]Gbrowse! [args] Like :Gbrowse, but put the URL on the clipboard rather
                        than opening it.

MAPPINGS                                        *fugitive-mappings*

These mappings are available in both the |:Gstatus| buffer and Fugitive object
buffers, although not all mappings make sense in all buffers.  Mappings that
operate on the file or hunk under the cursor are generally available in visual
mode to operate on multiple files or partial hunks.

X                       Discard the change under the cursor.  This uses
                        `checkout` or `clean` under the hood.  A command is
                        echoed that shows how to undo the change.  Consult
                        `:messages` to see it again.  You can use this during
                        a merge conflict do discard "our" changes (--theirs)
                        in the "Unstaged" section or discard "their" changes
                        (--ours) in the "Staged" section.

SPECIFYING OBJECTS                      *fugitive-object* *fugitive-revision*

Fugitive objects are either work tree files or Git revisions as defined in the
"SPECIFYING REVISIONS" section in the git-rev-parse man page, with expansions
inspired by |cmdline-special| layered on top.  For commands that accept an
optional object, the default is the file in the index for work tree files and
the work tree file for everything else.  Example objects follow.

Object          Meaning ~
@               The commit referenced by @ aka HEAD
master          The commit referenced by master
master^         The parent of the commit referenced by master
master...other  The merge base of master and other
master:         The tree referenced by master
./master        The file named master in the working directory
:(top)master    The file named master in the the work tree
Makefile        The file named Makefile in the work tree
@^:Makefile     The file named Makefile in the parent of HEAD
:Makefile       The file named Makefile in the index (writable)
@~2:%           The current file in the grandparent of HEAD
:%              The current file in the index
:1:%            The current file's common ancestor during a conflict
:2:#            The alternate file in the target branch during a conflict
:3:#5           The file from buffer #5 in the merged branch during a conflict
!               The commit owning the current file
!:Makefile      The file named Makefile in the commit owning the current file
!3^2            The second parent of the commit owning buffer #3
.git/config     The repo config file
:               Same as |:Gstatus|

STATUSLINE                                      *fugitive-statusline*

                                *FugitiveStatusline()* *fugitive#statusline()*
Add %{FugitiveStatusline()} to your statusline to get an indicator including
the current branch and the currently edited file's commit.  If you don't have
a statusline, this one matches the default when 'ruler' is set:
>
