# vim-expand-region

## About
[vim-expand-region] is a Vim plugin that allows you to visually select increasingly larger regions of text using the same key combination. It is similar to features from other editors:

- Emac's [expand region](https://github.com/magnars/expand-region.el)
- IntelliJ's [syntax aware selection](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/documentation/tips/#tips_code_editing)
- Eclipse's [select enclosing element](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4264047/intellij-ctrlw-equivalent-shortcut-in-eclipse)

## Installation
Install using [Pathogen], [Vundle], [Neobundle], or your favorite Vim package manager.

## Quick Start
Press ```+``` to expand the visual selection and ```_``` to shrink it.

## Mapping
Customize the key mapping if you don't like the default.

```
map K <Plug>(expand_region_expand)
map J <Plug>(expand_region_shrink)
```

## Setting
### Customize selected regions
The plugin uses __your own__ text objects to determine the expansion. You can customize the text objects the plugin knows about with ```g:expand_region_text_objects```.

```vim
" Default settings. (NOTE: Remove comments in dictionary before sourcing)
let g:expand_region_text_objects = {
      \ 'iw'  :0,
      \ 'iW'  :0,
      \ 'i"'  :0,
      \ 'i''' :0,
      \ 'i]'  :1, " Support nesting of square brackets
      \ 'ib'  :1, " Support nesting of parentheses
      \ 'iB'  :1, " Support nesting of braces
      \ 'il'  :0, " 'inside line'. Available through https://github.com/kana/vim-textobj-line
      \ 'ip'  :0,
      \ 'ie'  :0, " 'entire file'. Available through https://github.com/kana/vim-textobj-entire
      \ }
```

You can extend the global default dictionary by calling ```expand_region#custom_text_objects```:

```vim
" Extend the global default (NOTE: Remove comments in dictionary before sourcing)
call expand_region#custom_text_objects({
      \ "\/\\n\\n\<CR>": 1, " Motions are supported as well. Here's a search motion that finds a blank line
      \ 'a]' :1, " Support nesting of 'around' brackets
      \ 'ab' :1, " Support nesting of 'around' parentheses
      \ 'aB' :1, " Support nesting of 'around' braces
      \ 'ii' :0, " 'inside indent'. Available through https://github.com/kana/vim-textobj-indent
      \ 'ai' :0, " 'around indent'. Available through https://github.com/kana/vim-textobj-indent
      \ })
```

You can further customize the text objects dictionary on a per filetype basis by defining global variables like ```g:expand_region_text_objects_{ft}```.

```vim
" Use the following setting for ruby. (NOTE: Remove comments in dictionary  before sourcing)
let g:expand_region_text_objects_ruby = {
      \ 'im' :0, " 'inner method'. Available through https://github.com/vim-ruby/vim-ruby
      \ 'am' :0, " 'around method'. Available through https://github.com/vim-ruby/vim-ruby
      \ }
```

Note that this completely replaces the default dictionary. To extend the default on a per filetype basis, you can call ```expand_region#custom_text_objects``` by passing in the filetype in the first argument:

```vim
" Use the global default + the following for ruby
call expand_region#custom_text_objects('ruby', {
      \ 'im' :0,
      \ 'am' :0,
      \ })
```

### Customize selection mode
By default, after an expansion, the plugin leaves you in visual mode. If your ```selectmode```(h:selectmode)) contains ```cmd```, then the plugin will respect that setting and leave you in select mode. If you don't have ```selectmode``` set, but would like to default the expansion in select mode, you can use the global setting below:

```vim
let g:expand_region_use_select_mode = 1
```
