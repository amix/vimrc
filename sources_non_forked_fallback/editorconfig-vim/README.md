This is an [EditorConfig][] plugin for Vim. This plugin can be found on both
[GitHub][] and [Vim online][].

## Installation

To install this plugin, you can use one of the following ways:

### Install with the archive

Download the [archive][] and extract it into your Vim runtime directory
(`~/.vim` on UNIX/Linux and `$VIM_INSTALLATION_FOLDER\vimfiles` on windows).
You should have 3 sub-directories in this runtime directory now: "autoload",
"doc" and "plugin".

### Install as Vim8 plugin

Install as a Vim 8 plugin. Note `local` can be any name, but some path
element must be present. On Windows, instead of `~/.vim` use
`$VIM_INSTALLATION_FOLDER\vimfiles`.
```shell
mkdir -p ~/.vim/pack/local/start
cd ~/.vim/pack/local/start
git clone https://github.com/editorconfig/editorconfig-vim.git
```

### Install with [pathogen][]

Use pathogen (the git repository of this plugin is
https://github.com/editorconfig/editorconfig-vim.git)

### Install with [Vundle][]

Use Vundle by adding to your `.vimrc` Vundle plugins section:

```viml
Plugin 'editorconfig/editorconfig-vim'
```

Then call `:PluginInstall`.

### Install with [vim-plug][]

Use vim-plug by adding to your `.vimrc` in your plugin section:

```viml
Plug 'editorconfig/editorconfig-vim'
```

Source your `.vimrc` by calling `:source $MYVIMRC`.

Then call `:PlugInstall`.

### No external editorconfig core library is required

Previous versions of this plugin also required a Python "core".
The core included the code to parse `.editorconfig` files.
This plugin **includes** the core, so you don't need to download the
core separately.

## Supported properties

The EditorConfig Vim plugin supports the following EditorConfig [properties][]:

* `indent_style`
* `indent_size`
* `tab_width`
* `end_of_line`
* `charset`
* `insert_final_newline` (Feature `+fixendofline`, available on Vim 7.4.785+,
  or [PreserveNoEOL][] is required for this property)
* `trim_trailing_whitespace`
* `max_line_length`
* `root` (only used by EditorConfig core)

## Selected Options

The supported options are documented in [editorconfig.txt][]
and can be viewed by executing the following: `:help editorconfig`. You may
need to execute `:helptags ALL` so that Vim is aware of editorconfig.txt.

### Excluded patterns

To ensure that this plugin works well with [Tim Pope's fugitive][], use the
following patterns array:

```viml
let g:EditorConfig_exclude_patterns = ['fugitive://.*']
```

If you wanted to avoid loading EditorConfig for any remote files over ssh:

```viml
let g:EditorConfig_exclude_patterns = ['scp://.*']
```

Of course these two items could be combined into the following:

```viml
let g:EditorConfig_exclude_patterns = ['fugitive://.*', 'scp://.*']
```

### Disable for a specific filetype

You can disable this plugin for a specific buffer by setting
`b:EditorConfig_disable`.  Therefore, you can disable the
plugin for all buffers of a specific filetype. For example, to disable
EditorConfig for all git commit messages (filetype `gitcommit`):

```viml
au FileType gitcommit let b:EditorConfig_disable = 1
```

### Disable rules

In very rare cases,
you might need to override some project-specific EditorConfig rules in global
or local vimrc in some cases, e.g., to resolve conflicts of trailing whitespace
trimming and buffer autosaving.  This is not recommended, but you can:

```viml
let g:EditorConfig_disable_rules = ['trim_trailing_whitespace']
```

You are able to disable any supported EditorConfig properties.
