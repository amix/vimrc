<!--
Thanks for your interest in reporting an issue.

Before submitting, please refer to the following common issues and solutions:

Running vim in a terminal?
- Try adding `set termguicolors` to your vimrc.

Running vim with tmux?
- Be sure you have terminal-overrides to enable truecolor (if supported in your term)
- Be sure your `default-terminal` is set to, ideally, `tmux-256color`. If your OS doesn't
  have `tmux-256color` terminfo files, google them and add them using `tic`

Having issues with font styles (italic, bold, underline)?
- Be sure your terminal supports these styles.
- If running tmux, see tmux section.
- If all else fails, disable the style by setting `let g:dracula_<style-name> = 0`
  in your vimrc, where `<style-name>` is one of (`italic`, `bold`, `underline`, `undercurl`, `inverse`)

If the above did not resolve your issue, please complete all fields of the form below.
