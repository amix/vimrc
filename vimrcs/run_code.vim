"   Following code contains the commands on how to run the currently open code.
"   The default mapping is set to F5 like most code editors out there.
"   Change it as you feel comfortable with, keeping in mind that it does not
"   clash with any other keymapping.
"   
"   NOTE: Compilers for different systems may differ. For example, in the case
"   of C and C++, we have assumed it to be gcc and g++ respectively, but it may
"   not be the same. It is suggested to check first if the compilers are installed
"   before running the code, or maybe even switch to a different compiler.
"
"   NOTE: Adding support for more programming languages
"
"   Just add another elseif block before the 'endif' statement in the same
"   way it is done in each case. Take care to add tabbed spaces after each
"   elseif block (similar to python). For example:
"   
"   elseif &filetype == '<your_file_extension>'
"       exec '!<your_compiler> %'
"
"   NOTE: The '%' sign indicates the name of the currently open file with extension.
"         The time command displays the time taken for execution. Remove the
"         time command if you dont want the system to display the time
"
