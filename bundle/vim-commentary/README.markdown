# commentary.vim

Comment stuff out.  Use `gcc` to comment out a line (takes a count),
`gc` to comment out the target of a motion (for example, `gcap` to
comment out a paragraph), and `gc` in visual mode to comment out the
selection.  That's it.

I wrote this because 5 years after Vim added support for mapping an
operator, I still couldn't find a commenting plugin that leveraged that
feature (I overlooked
[tcomment.vim](https://github.com/tomtom/tcomment_vim)).  Striving for
minimalism, it weighs in at under 100 lines of code.

Oh, and it uncomments, too.  The above maps actually toggle, and `gcu`
uncomments a set of adjacent commented lines.  Install
[repeat.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-repeat) to enable
repeating `gcu` with `.`.  (The other maps are repeatable without it.)

## Installation

If you don't have a preferred installation method, I recommend
installing [pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen), and
then simply copy and paste:

    cd ~/.vim/bundle
    git clone git://github.com/tpope/vim-commentary.git

Once help tags have been generated, you can view the manual with
`:help commentary`.

## FAQ

> My favorite file type isn't supported!

Relax!  You just have to adjust `'commentstring'`:

    autocmd FileType apache set commentstring=#\ %s
